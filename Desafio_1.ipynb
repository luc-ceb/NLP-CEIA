XRemote? PPP? SLIP? CSLIP?\n","\n","There are several options for using X over serial lines:\n","\n","SLIP - Serial Line IP; this is both a mechanism and a protocol for sending IP\n","packets over point-to-point serial links. It has been around for several years,\n","and implementations are available for many of the major TCP/IP implementations.\n","Most X Terminal vendors supply this as a checkoff item, although nobody really \n","ever uses it since it is horribly slow.  The TCP/IP headers add 40 bytes per \n","packet and the TCP/IP encoding of the X protocol is rather verbose (rightfully \n","so; it is optimized for packing and unpacking over high-speed links). \n","\n","CSLIP - Compressed header SLIP; this is a variant of SLIP that compresses the \n","40 bytes of TCP/IP headers down to about 5 or 6 bytes.  It still doesn't do \n","anything about reencoding the X protocol.  Modems that do compression can help,\n","but they increase packet latency (it takes time to dribble the uncompressed \n","data through typical serial interfaces, plus the compression assembly time).\n","\n","PPP - Point-to-Point Protocol; this is an emerging standard for point-to-point\n","links over serial lines that has a more complete set of option negotiation than\n","SLIP.  A growing number of people see the combination of PPP for the serial \n","line management and CSLIP for the header compression as becoming common for \n","running normal TCP/IP protocols over serial lines.  Running raw X over the wire\n","still needs compression somewhere to make it usable.\n","\n","XRemote - this is the name of both a protocol and set of products originally\n","developed by NCD for squeezing the X protocol over serial lines.  In addition \n","to using a low level transport mechanism similar to PPP/CSLIP, XRemote removes \n","redundancies in the X protocol by sending deltas against previous packets and \n","using LZW to compress the entire data stream.  This work is done by either a \n","pseudo-X server or \"proxy\" running on the host or in a terminal server.  There \n","are several advantages to doing compression outside the modem:\n","   (1)\tYou don't *have* to have compressing modems in there if you wouldn't \n","\totherwise be using them (e.g. if you were going to be directly \n","\tconnected), and\n","   (2)\tIt reduces the I/O overhead by cutting down on the number of bytes that\n","\thave to cross the serial interface, and\n","   (3)\tIn addition to the effects of #2, it reduces the latency in delivering \n","\tpackets by not requiring the modem to buffer up the data waiting for \n","\tblocks to compress.\n","\n","LBX - Low Bandwidth X; this is an X Consortium project that is working on a\n","standard for this area.  It is being chaired by NCD and Xerox and is using \n","NCD's XRemote protocol as a stepping stone in developing the new protocol.  LBX\n","will go beyond XRemote by adding proxy caching of commonly-used information \n","(e.g. connection setup data, large window properties, font metrics, keymaps, \n","etc.) and a more efficient encoding of the X protocol.

And this aging Armenian . . . his name was Uncle \n","Arkady, I think, because someone said \"Arkady, get an injection ready,\" he \n","started to fill a syringe, and turned around so as to give Karina a shot. But \n","when he looked at her face he became ill. And he was an old man, in his \n","sixties, his hair was all grey, and his moustache, too. He hugged Karina and \n","started to cry: \"What have they done to you?!\" He was speaking Armenian. \"What\n","have they done to you?!\" Karina didn't say anything. Mamma came in then, and \n","she started to cry, too. The man tried to calm her. \"I'll give you a shot.\" \n","Mamma tells him, \"I don't need any shot. Where is the government? Just what \n","are they doing? Look what they've done to my children! They're killing people,\n","and you're just sitting here!\" Some teacups were standing on the table in \n","there. \"You're sitting here drinking tea! Look what they've done to my \n","daughters! Look what they've turned them into!\" They gave her something to \n","drink, some heart medicine, I think. They gave Karina an injection and the\n","doctor said that she had to be taken to the Maternity Home immediately. Papa \n","and Urshan, I think, even though Papa was in bad shape, helped carry Karina \n","out. When they put her on the stretcher, none of the medics got near her. I \n","don't know, maybe there weren't any orderlies. Then they came to me: \"What's \n","the matter with you?\" Their tone was so official that I wrapped myself tighter\n","in the half-length coat. I had a blanket on, too, an orange one, Aunt Tanya's.\n","I said, \"I'm fine.\" Uncle Arkady came over and was soothing me, and then told \n","the doctor, \"You leave, let a woman examine her.\" A woman came, an \n","Azerbaijani, I believe, and said, \"What's wrong with you?\" I was wearing my \n","sister Lyuda's nightshirt, the sister who at this time was in Yerevan. When \n","she was nursing her infant she had cut out a big hole in it so that it would \n","be easier to breast feed the baby. I tore the night shirt some more and showed\n","her. I took it off my shoulders and turned my back to her. There was a huge \n","wound, about the size of a hand, on my back, from the Indian vase. She said \n","something to them and they gave me two shots. She said that it should be \n","dressed with something, but that they'd do that in the hospital.\n","\n","They put me on a stretcher, too. They started looking for people to carry me. \n","I raised up my head a little and wanted to sit up, and this woman, I don't \n","know if she was a doctor or a nurse, said, \"Lie still, you mustn't move.\" When\n","I was lying back down I saw two policemen leading a man. His profile seemed \n","very familiar to me. I shouted, \"Stop!\" One of the policemen turned and says, \n","\"What do you want?\" I say, \"Bring him to me, I want to look at him.\" They \n","brought him over and I said, \"That person was just in our apartment and he \n","just raped me and my sister. I recognize him, note it down.\" They said, \n","\"Fine,\" but didn't write it down and led him on. I don't know where they were \n","taking him.\n","\n","Then they put my stretcher near where the injured and beaten soldiers were \n","sitting. They went to look for the ambulance driver so he would bring the car \n","up closer. One of the soldiers started talking to me, \"Sister . . . \" I don't \n","remember the conversation exactly, but he asked me were we lived and what they\n","did to us. I asked him, \"Where are you from?\" He said that he was from Ufa. \n","Apparently they were the first that were brought in. The Ufa police. Later I \n","learned that they suffered most of all. He says, \"OK, you're Armenians, they \n","didn't get along with you, but I'm a Russian,\" he says, \"what are they trying \n","to kill me for?\" Oh, I remembered something else. When I went out onto the \n","balcony with Kuliyev for a hammer and nails I looked out the window and saw \n","two Azerbaijanis beating a soldier near the kindergarten. He was pressed \n","against the fence and he covered his head with his arms, they were beating him\n","with his own club. The way he cried \"Mamma\" made my skin crawl. I don't know \n","what they did to him, if he's still alive or not. And something else. Before \n","he attack on our house we saw sheets, clothes, and some dishes flying from the\n","third or fourth floor of the neighboring building, but I didn't think it was \n","Azerbaijanis attacking Armenians. I thought that something was on fire or they\n","were throwing something they didn't need out, or someone was fighting with \n","someone. It was only later, when they were burning a passenger car in the \n","yard, when the neighbors said that they were doing that to the Armenians, that\n","I realized that this was serious, that it was anti-Armenian.\n","\n","They took Karina and me to the Sumgait Maternity Home. Mamma went to them too \n","and said, \"I've been beaten too, help me.\" But they just ignored her. My \n","father went to them and said in a guilty voice, as though it was his fault \n","that he'd been beaten, and says, \"My ribs hurt so much, those creeps have \n","probably broken my ribs. Please look at them.\" The doctor says, \"That's not my\n","job.\" Urshan said, \"Fine, I'll take you to my place and if we need a doctor, \n","I'll find you one. I'll bring one and have him look at you. And he drove them \n","to his apartment.\n","\n","Marina and I stayed there. They examined us. I was more struck by what the \n","doctor said than by what those Azerbaijanis in our apartment did to us. I \n","wasn't surprised when they beat us they wanted to beat us, but I was very\n","surprised that in a Soviet medical facility a woman who had taken the\n","Hippocratic Oath could talk to victims like that. By happy--or unhappy--\n","coincidence we were seen by the doctor that had delivered our Karina. And she,\n","having examined Karina, said, \"No problem, you got off pretty good. Not like \n","they did in Kafan, when you Armenians were killing and raping our women.\n","\"Karina was in such terrible condition that she couldn't say anything--she\n","would certainly have had something to say! Then they examined me. The same \n","story. They put us in a separate ward. No shots, no medicinal powders, no \n","drugs. Absolutely none! They didn't even give us tea. All the women there soon\n","found out that in ward such and such were Armenians who had been raped. And\n","they started coming and peering through the keyhole, the way people look at \n","zoo animals. Karina didn't see this, she was lying there, and I kept her from \n","seeing it.\n","\n","They put Ira B. in our ward. She had also been raped. True, she didn't have \n","any serious bodily injuries, but when she told me what had happened at their \n","place, I felt worse for them than I did for us. Because when they raped Ira \n","her daughter was in the room, she was under the bed on which it happened. And\n","Ira was holding her daughter's hand, the one who was hiding under the bed.\n","When they were beating Ira or taking her earrings off, gold, when she \n","involuntarily let go of her daughter's hand, her daughter took her hand again.\n","Her daughter is in the fourth grade, she's 11 years old. I felt really awful \n","when I heard that. Ira asked them not to harm her daughter, she said, \"Do what\n","you want with me, just leave my daughter alone.\" Well, they did what they \n","wanted. They threatened to kill her daughter if she got in their way. Now I \n","would be surprised if the criminals had behaved any other way that night. It \n","was simply Bartholomew's Night, I say, they did what they would love to do \n","every day: steal, kill, rape . . .\n","\n","Many are surprised that those animals didn't harm the children. The beasts \n","explained it like this: this would be repeated in 15 to 20 years, and those \n","children would be grown, and then, as they put it, \"we'll come take the \n","pleasure out of their lives, those children.\" This was about the girls that\n","would be young women in 15 years. They were thinking about their tomorrow \n","because they were sure that there would be no trial and no investigation, just\n","as there was no trial or investigation in 1915, and that those girls could be \n","of some use in 15 years. This I heard from the investigators; one of the \n","victims testified to it. That's how they described their own natures, that\n","they would still be bloodthirsty in 15 to 20 years, and in 100 years--they\n","themselves said that.\n","\n","And this, too. Everyone is surprised that they didn't harm our Marina. Many \n","people say that they either were drunk or had smoked too much. I don't know \n","why their eyes were red. Maybe because they hadn't slept the night before, \n","maybe for some other reason, I don't know. But they hadn't been smoking and \n","they weren't drunk, I'm positive, because someone who has smoked will stop at \n","nothing he has the urge to do. And they spoke in a cultured fashion with \n","Marina: \"Little sister, don't be afraid, we won't harm you, don't look over \n","there [where I was], you might be frightened. You're a Muslim, a Muslim woman \n","shouldn't see such things.\" So they were really quite sober . . .\n","\n","So we came out of that story alive. Each every day we have lived since it all \n","happened bears the mark of that day. It wasn't even a day, of those several \n","hours. Father still can't look us in the eyes. He still feels guilty for what\n","happened to Karina, Mother, and me. Because of his nerves he's started talk-\n","ing to himself, I've heard him argue with himself several times when he\n","thought no one is listening: \"Listen,\" he'll say, \"what could I do? What could\n","I do alone, how could I protect them?\" I don't know where to find the words,\n","it's not that I'm happy, but I am glad that he didn't see it all happen. \n","That's the only thing they spared us . . . or maybe it happened by chance. Of \n","course he knows it all, but there's no way you could imagine every last detail\n","of what happened. And there were so many conversations: Karina and I spoke\n","together in private, and we talked with Mamma, too. But Father was never\n","present at those conversations. We spare him that, if you can say that. And\n","when the investigator comes to the house, we don't speak with Father present.\n","\n","On February 29, the next clay, Karina and I were discharged from the hospital.\n","First they released me, but since martial law had been declared in the city, \n","the soldiers took me to the police precinct in an armored personnel carrier. \n","There were many people there, Armenian victims. I met the Tovmasian family \n","there. From them I learned that Rafik and their Uncle Grant had died. They \n","were sure that both had died. They were talking to me and Raya, Rafik's wife \n","and Grant's daughter, and her mother, were both crying.\n","\n","Then they took us all out of the office on the first floor into the yard.\n","There's a little one-room house outside there, a recreation and reading area.\n","They took us in there. The women were afraid to go because they thought\n","that they were shooing us out of the police precinct because it had become\n","so dangerous that even the people working at the precinct wanted to hide.\n","The women were shouting. They explained to them: \"We want to hide you\n","better because it's possible there will be an attack on the police precinct.\"\n","\n","We went into the little house. There were no chairs or tables in there. We\n","had children with us and they were hungry; we even had infants who needed to \n","have their diapers changed. No one had anything with them. It was just awful. \n","They kept us there for 24 hours. From the window of the one room house you \n","could see that there were Azerbaijanis standing on the fences around the \n","police precinct, as though they were spying on us. The police precinct is \n","surrounded by a wall, like a fence, and it's electrified, but if they were \n","standing on the wall, it means the electricity was shut off. This brought \n","great psychological pressure to bear on us, particularly on those who hadn't \n","just walked out of their apartments, but who hadn't slept for 24 hours, or 48,\n","or those who had suffered physically and spiritually, the ones who had lost \n","family members. For us it was another ordeal. We were especially frightened \n","when all the precinct employees suddenly disappeared. We couldn't see a single\n","person, not in the courtyard and not in the windows. We thought that they must\n","have already been hiding under the building, that they must have some secret \n","room down there. People were panicking: they started throwing themselves at\n","one another . . . That's the way it is on a sinking ship. We heard those \n","people, mainly young people, whistling and whopping on the walls. We felt that\n","the end was approaching. I was completely terrified: I had left Karina in the \n","hospital and didn't know where my parents were. I was sort of calm about my \n","parents, I was thinking only about Karina, if, Heaven forbid, they should \n","attack the hospital, they would immediately tell them that there was an \n","Armenian in there, and something terrible would happen to Karina again, and \n","she wouldn't be able to take it.\n","\n","Then soldiers with dogs appeared. When they saw the dogs some of the people \n","climbed down off the fence. Then they brought in about another 30 soldiers.\n","They all had machine guns in readiness, their fingers on the triggers. We \n","calmed down a little. They brought us chairs and brought the children some \n","little cots and showed us where we could wash our hands, and took the children\n","to the toilet. But we all sat there hungry, but to be honest, it would never \n","have occurred to any of us that we hadn't eaten for two days and that people \n","do eat.\n","\n","Then, closer to nightfall, they brought a group of detained criminals. They \n","were being watched by soldiers with guard dogs. One of the men came back from \n","the courtyard and told us about it. Raya Tovmasian . . . it was like a \n","different woman had been substituted. Earlier she had been crying, wailing, \n","and calling out: \"Oh, Rafik!,\" but when she heard about this such a rage came \n","over her! She jumped up, she had a coat on, and she started to roll up her \n","sleeves like she was getting ready to beat someone. And suddenly there were \n","soldiers, and dogs, and lots of people. She ran over to them. The bandits were\n","standing there with their hands above their heads facing the wall. She went up\n","to one of them and grabbed him by the collar and started to shake and thrash \n","him! Then, on to a second, and a third. Everyone was rooted to the spot. Not \n","one of the soldiers moved, no one went up to help or made her stop her from \n","doing it. And the bandits fell down and covered their heads with their hands, \n","muttering something. She came back and sat down, and something akin to a smile\n","appeared on her face. She became so quiet: no tears, no cries. Then that round\n","was over and she went back to beat them again. She was walking and cursing \n","terribly: take that, and that, they killed my husband, the bastards, the \n","creeps, and so on. Then she came back again and sat down. She probably did \n","this the whole night through, well, it wasn't really night, no one slept. She \n","went five or six times and beat them and returned. And she told the women, \n","\"What are you sitting there for? They killed your husbands and children, they \n","raped, and you're just sitting there. You're sitting and talking as though \n","nothing had happened. Aren't you Armenians?\" She appealed to everyone, but no \n","one got up. I was just numb, I didn't have the strength to beat anyone, I \n","could barely hold myself up, all the more so since I had been standing for so \n","many hours--I was released at eleven o'clock in the morning and it was already\n","after ten at night because there weren't enough chairs, really it was the \n","elderly and women with children who sat. I was on my feet the whole time. \n","There was nothing to breathe, the door was closed, and the men were smoking. \n","The situation was deplorable.\n","\n","At eleven o'clock at night policemen came for us, local policemen, \n","Azerbaijanis. They said, \"Get up. They've brought mattresses, you can wash up\n","and put the children to bed.\" Now the women didn't want to leave this place, \n","either. The place had become like home, it was safe, there were soldiers with \n","dogs. If anyone went outside, the soldiers would say, \"Oh, it's our little \n","family,\" and things like that. The soldiers felt this love, and probably, for \n","the first time in their lives perceived themselves as defenders. Everyone\n","spoke from the heart, cried, and hugged them and they, with their loaded\n","machine guns in their hands, said, \"Grandmother, you mustn't approach me,\n","I'm on guard.\" Our people would say, \"Oh, that's all right.\" They hugged\n","them, one woman even kissed one of the machine guns. This was all terribly\n","moving for me. And the small children kept wanting to pet the dogs.\n","\n","They took us up to the second floor and said, \"You can undress and sleep in \n","here. Don't be afraid, the precinct is on guard, and it's quiet in the city.\"\n","This was the 29th, when the killing was going on in block 41A and in other\n","places. Then we were told that all the Armenians were being gathered at the\n","SK club and at the City Party Committee. They took us there. On the way I \n","asked them to stop at the Maternity Home: I wanted to take Karina with me.\n","I didn't know what was happening there. They told me, \"Don't worry, the\n","Maternity Home is full of soldiers, more than mothers-to-be. So you can rest\n","assured. I say, \"Well, I won't rest assured regardless, because the staff in\n","there is capable of anything.\"\n","\n","When I arrived at the City Party Committee it turned out that Karina had\n","already been brought there. They had seen fit to release her from the hospi-\n","tal, deciding that she felt fine and was no longer in need of any care. Once\n","we were in the City Party Committee we gave free reign to our tears. We met \n","acquaintances, but everyone was somehow divided into two groups, those who \n","hadn't been injured, who were clothed, who had brought a pot of food with \n","them, and so on, and those, like me, like Raya, who were wearing whatever had \n","come their way. There were even people who were all made up, dolled up like \n","they had come from a wedding. There were people without shoes, naked people, \n","hungry people, those who were crying, and those who had lost someone. And of \n","course the stories and the talk were flying: \"Oh, I heard that they killed \n","him!\" \"What do you mean they killed him!\" \"He stayed at work!\" \"Do you know \n","what's happening at this and such a plant? Talk like that.\n","\n","And then I met Aleksandr Mikhailovich Gukasian, the teacher. I know him very \n","well and respect him highly. I've known him for a long time. They had a small \n","room, well really it was more like a study-room. We spent a whole night \n","talking in that study once. On March 1 we heard that Bagirov [First Secretary \n","of the Communist Party of Azerbaijan SSR] had arrived. Everyone ran to see \n","Bagirov, what news he had brought with him and how this was all being viewed \n","from outside. He arrived and everyone went up to him to talk to him and ask \n","him things. Everyone was in a tremendous rage. But he was protected by \n","soldiers, and he went up to the second floor and didn't deign to speak with \n","the people. Apparently he had more important things to do.\n","\n","Several hours passed. Gukasian called me and says, \"Lyudochka, find another \n","two or three. We're going to make up lists, they asked for them upstairs, \n","lists of the dead, those whose whereabouts are unknown, and lists of people \n","who had pogroms of their apartments and of those whose cars were burned.\" I \n","had about 50 people in my list when they called me and said, \"Lyuda, your \n","Mamma has arrived, she's looking for you, she doesn't believe that you are \n","alive and well and that you're here.\" I gave the lists to someone and asked \n","them to continue what I was doing and went off.\n","\n","The list was imprecise, of course. It included Grant Adamian, Raya Tovmasian's\n","father, who was alive, but at the time they thought him dead. There was Engels\n","Grigorian's father and aunt, Cherkez and Maria. The list also included the \n","name of my girlfriend and neighbor, Zhanna Agabekian. One of the guys said \n","that he had been told that they chopped her head off in the courtyard in front\n","of the Kosmos movie theater. We put her on the list too, and cried, but later \n","it turned out that that was just a rumor, that in fact an hour earlier she had\n","somehow left Sumgait for the marina and from there had set sail for \n","Krasnovodsk, where, thank God, she was alive and well. I should also say that \n","in addition to those who died that list contained people who were rumored \n","missing or who were so badly wounded that they were given up for dead.                                                                 3\n","\n","All the lists were taken to Bagirov. I don't remember how many dead were \n","contained in the list, but it's a fact that when Gukasian came in a couple \n","of minutes later he was cursing and was terribly irate. I asked, \"What's \n","going on?\" He said, \"Lyuda, can you imagine what animals, what scoundrels\n","they are! They say that they lost the list of the dead. Piotr Demichev\n","[Member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party\n","of the USSR] has just arrived, and we were supposed to submit the list to\n","him, so that he'd see the scope of the slaughter, of the tragedy, whether it\n","was one or fifty.\" They told him that the list had disappeared and they\n","should ask everyone who hadn't left for the Khimik boarding house all over\n","again. There were 26 people on our second list. I think that the number 26\n","was the one that got into the press and onto television and the radio, because\n","that's the list that Demichev got. I remember exactly that there were 26 \n","people on the list, I had even told Aleksandr Mikhailovich that that was only \n","a half of those that were on the first list. He said, \"Lyuda, please, try to\n","remember at least one more.\" But I couldn't remember anyone else. But there\n","were more than 30 dead. Of that I am certain. The government and the Procuracy\n","don't count the people who died of fright, like sick people and old people \n","whose lives are threatened by any shock. They weren't registered as victims of\n","the Sumgait tragedy. And then there may be people we didn't know. So many \n","people left Sumgait between March 1 and 8! Most of them left for smaller towns\n","in Russia, and especially to the Northern Caucasus, to Stavropol, and the \n","Krasnodarsk Territory. We don't have any information on them. I know that \n","there are people who set out for parts around Moscow. In the periodical \n","Krestyanka [Woman Farmer] there was a call for people who know how to milk \n","cows, and for mechanics, and drivers, and I know a whole group of people went \n","to help out. Also clearly not on our list are those people who died entering\n","the city, who were burned in their cars. No one knows about them, except the \n","Azerbaijanis, who are hardly likely to say anything about it. And there's\n","more. A great many of the people who were raped were not included in the list \n","drawn up at the Procuracy. I know of three instances for sure, and I of course\n","don't know them all. I'm thinking of three women whose parents chose not to \n","publicize what had happened, that is, they didn't take the matter to court, \n","they simply left. But in so doing they didn't cease being victims. One of them\n","is the first cousin of my classmate Kocharian. She lived in Microdistrict No. \n","8, on the fifth floor. I can't tell you the building number and I don't know \n","her name. Then comes the neighbor of one of my relatives, she lived in \n","Microdistrict 1 near the gift shop. I don't know her name, she lives on the \n","same landing as the Sumgait procurator. They beat her father, he was holding \n","the door while his daughter hid, but he couldn't hold the door forever, and \n","when she climbed over the balcony to the neighbors' they seized her by her \n","braid. Like the Azerbaijanis were saying, it was a very cultured mob, because \n","they didn't kill anyone, they only raped them and left. And the third one \n",". . . I don't remember who the third one was anymore.\n","\n","They transferred us on March 1. Karina still wasn't herself. Yes, we lived for\n","days in the SK, in the cultural facility, and at the Khimik. They lived there \n","and I lived at the City Party Committee because I couldn't stay with Karina; \n","it was too difficult for me, but I was at peace: she had survived. I could \n","already walk, but really it was honest words that held me up. Thanks to the \n","social work I did there, I managed to persevere. Aleksandr Mikhailovich said, \n","\"If it weren't for the work I would go insane.\" He and I put ourselves in gear\n","and took everything upon ourselves: someone had an infant and needed diapers \n","and free food, and we went to get them. The first days we bought everything, \n","although we should have received it for free. They were supposed to have been \n","dispensed free of charge, and they sold it to us. Then, when we found out it \n","was free, we went to Krayev. At the time, fortunately, you could still drop by\n","to see him like a neighbor, all the more so since everything was still clearly\n","visible on our faces. Krayev sent a captain down and he resolved the issue.\n","\n","On March 2 they sent two investigators to see us: Andrei Shirokov and Vladimir\n","Fedorovich Bibishev. The way it worked out, in our family they had considered \n","only Karina and me victims, maybe because she and I wound up in the hospital.\n","Mother and Father are considered witnesses, but not victims.\n","\n","Shirokov was involved with Karina's case, and Bibishev, with mine. After I \n","told him everything, he and I planned to sit down with the identikit and\n","record everyone I could remember while everything was still fresh in my mind. \n","We didn't work with the identikit until the very last day because the\n","conditions weren't there. The investigative group worked slowly and did poor \n","quality work solely because the situation wasn't conducive to working: there \n","weren't enough automobiles, especially during the time when there was a \n","curfew, and there were no typewriters for typing transcripts, and no still or \n","video cameras. I think that this was done on purpose. We're not so poor that \n","we can't supply our investigators with all that stuff. It was done especially \n","to draw out the investigation, all the more so since the local authorities saw\n","that the Armenians were leaving at the speed of light, never to return to \n","Sumgait. And the Armenians had a lot to say I came to an agreement with \n","Bibishev, I told him myself, \"Don't you worry, if it takes us a month or two \n","months, I'll be here. I'm not afraid, I looked death in the eyes five times in\n","those two days, I'll help you conduct the investigation.\"\n","\n","He and I worked together a great deal, and I used this to shelter Karina, I\n","gave them so much to do that for a while they didn't have the time to get to\n","her, so that she would at least have a week or two to get back to being her-\n","self. She was having difficulty breathing so we looked for a doctor to take x-\n","rays. She couldn't eat or drink for nine days, she was nauseous. I didn't eat\n","and drank virtually nothing for five days. Then, on the fifth day, when we\n","were in Baku already, the investigator told me, \"How long can you go on like \n","this? Well fine, so you don't want to eat, you don't love yourself, you're\n","not taking care of yourself, but you gave your word that you would see this\n","investigation through. We need you.\" Then I started eating, because in fact I\n","was exhausted. It wasn't enough that I kept seeing those faces in our apart-\n","ment in my mind, every day I went to the investigative solitary confinement\n","cells and prisons. I don't know . . . we were just everywhere! Probably in\n","every prison in the city of Baku and in all the solitary confinement cells of\n","Sumgait. At that time they had even turned the drunk tank into solitary \n","confinement.\n","\n","Thus far I have identified 31 of the people who were in our apartment. Mamma \n","identified three, and Karina, two. The total is 36. Marina didn't identify \n","anyone, she remembers the faces of two or three, But they weren't among the \n","photographs of those detained. I told of the neighbor I recognized. The one \n","who went after the axe. He still hasn't been detained, he's still on the \n","loose. He's gone, and it's not clear if he will be found or not. I don't know \n","his first or last name. I know which building he lived in and I know his \n","sisters' faces. But he's not in the city. The investigators informed me that \n","even if the investigation is closed and even if the trial is over they will \n","continue looking for him.\n","\n","The 31 people I identified are largely blue-collar workers from various \n","plants, without education, and of the very lowest level in every respect.\n","Mostly their ages range from 20 to 30 years; there was one who was 48. Only\n","one of them was a student. He was attending the Azerbaijan Petroleum and\n","Chemical Institute in Sumgait, his mother kept trying to bribe the investiga-\n","tor. Once, thinking that I was an employee and not a victim, she said in front\n","of me \"I'll set you up a restaurant worth 500 rubles and give you 600 in cash\n","simply for keeping him out of Armenia,\" that is, to keep him from landing in\n","a prison on Armenian soil. They're all terribly afraid of that, because if the\n","investigator is talking with a criminal and the criminal doesn't confess even\n","though we identified him, they tell him--in order to apply psychological\n","pressure--they say, \"Fine, don't confess, just keep silent. When you're in an\n","Armenian prison, when they find out who you are, they'll take care of you\n","in short order.\" That somehow gets to them. Many give in and start to talk.\n","\n","The investigators and I were in our apartment and videotaped the entire\n","pogrom of our apartment, as an investigative experiment. It was only then\n","that I saw the way they had left our apartment. Even without knowing who was \n","in our apartment, you could guess. They stole, for example, all the money and \n","all the valuables, but didn't take a single book. They tore them up, burned \n","them, poured water on them, and hacked them with axes. Only the Materials\n","from the 27th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and James \n","Fenimore Cooper's Last of the Mohigans. Oh yes, lunch was ready, we were \n","boiling a chicken, and there were lemons for tea on the table. After they had \n","been in our apartment, both the chicken and the lemons were gone. That's \n","enough to tell you what kind of people were in our apartment, people who don't\n","even know anything about books. They didn't take a single book, but they did \n","take worn clothing, food, and even the cheapest of the cheap, worn-out \n","slippers.\n","\n","Of those whom I identified, four were Kafan Azerbaijanis living in Sumgait. \n","Basically, the group that went seeking \"revenge\"--let's use their word for \n","it--was joined by people seeking easy gain and thrill-seekers. I talked with \n","one of them. He had gray eyes, and somehow against the back-drop of all that \n","black I remembered him specifically because of his of his eyes. Besides taking\n","part in the pogrom of our apartment, he was also involved in the murder of \n","Tamara Mekhtiyeva from Building 16. She was an older Armenian who had recently\n","arrived from Georgia, she lived alone and did not have anyone in Sumgait. I \n","don't know why she had a last name like that, maybe she was married to an \n","Azerbaijani. I had laid eyes on this woman only once or twice, and know \n","nothing about her. I do know that they murdered her in her apartment with an \n","axe. Murdering her wasn't enough for them. They hacked her into pieces and \n","threw them into the tub with water.\n","\n","I remember another guy really well too, he was also rather fair-skinned. You \n","know, all the people who were in our apartment were darker than dark, both \n","their hair and their skin. And in contrast with them, in addition to the grey-\n","eyed one, I remember this one fellow, the one l took to be a Lezgin. I \n","identified him. As it turned out he was Eduard Robertovich Grigorian, born\n","in the city of Sumgait, and he had been convicted twice. One of our own. How \n","did I remember him? The name Rita was tattooed on his left or right hand. I \n","kept thinking, is that Rita or \"puma,\" which it would be if you read the word \n","as Latin characters instead of Cyrillic, because the Cyrillic \"T\" was the one \n","that looks like a Latin \"M.\" When they led him in he sat with his hands behind\n","his back. This was at the confrontation. He swore on every holy book, tried to\n","put in an Armenian word here and there to try and spark my compassion, and \n","told me that I was making a mistake, and called me \"dear sister.\" He said, \n","\"You're wrong, how could I, an Armenian, raise my hand against my own, an \n","Armenian,\" and so on. He spoke so convincingly that even the investigator \n","asked me, \"Lyuda, are you sure it was he?\" I told him, \"I'll tell you one more\n","identifying mark. If I'm wrong I shall apologize and say I was mistaken. The \n","name Rita is tattooed on his left or right hand.\" He went rigid and became \n","pale. They told him, \"Put your hands on the table.\" He put his hands on the\n","table with the palms up. I said, \"Now turn your hands over,\" but he didn't \n","turn his hands over. Now this infuriated me. If he had from the very start\n","acknowledged his guilt and said that he hadn't wanted to do it, that they \n","forced him or something else, I would have treated him somewhat differently.\n","But he insolently stuck to his story, \"No, I did not do anything, it wasn't \n","me.\" When they turned his hands over the name Rita was in fact tattooed on his\n","hand. His face distorted and he whispered something wicked. I immediately flew\n","into a rage. There was an ashtray on the table, a really heavy one, made out \n","of granite or something, very large, and it had ashes and butts in it. \n","Catching myself quite by surprise, I hurled that ashtray at him. But he ducked\n","and the ashtray hit the wall, and ashes and butts rained down on his head and \n","back. And he smiled. When he smiled it provoked me further. I don't know how, \n","but I jumped over the table between us and started either pounding him or \n","strangling him; I no longer remember which. When I jumped I caught the \n","microphone cord. The investigator was there, Tolya . . .I no longer recall his\n","last name, and he says, \"Lyudochka, it's a Japanese microphone! Please . . .\n","\" And shut off all the equipment on the spot, it was all being video taped. \n","They took him away. I stayed, and they talked to me a little to calm me down, \n","because we needed to go on working, I only remember Tolya telling me, \"You're \n","some actress! What a performance!\" I said, \"Tolya, honestly . . . \" Beforehand\n","they would always tell me, \"Lyuda, more emotion. You speak as calmly as if \n","nothing had happened to you.\" I say, \"I don't have any more strength or \n","emotion. All my emotions are behind me now, I no longer have the strength \n",". . . I don't have the strength to do anything.\" And he says, \"Lyuda, how were\n","you able to do that?\" And when I returned to normal, drinking tea and watching\n","the tape, I said, \"Can I really have jumped over that table? I never jumped \n","that high in gym class.\"\n","\n","So you could say the gang that took over our apartment was international. Of \n","the 36 we identified there was an Armenian, a Russian, Vadim Vorobyev, who \n","beat Mamma, and 34 Azerbaijanis.\n","\n","At the second meeting with Grigorian, when he had completely confessed his \n","guilt, he told of how on February 27 the Azerbaijanis had come knocking. Among\n","them were guys--if you can call them guys--he knew from prison. They said, \n","\"Tomorrow we're going after the Armenians. Meet us at the bus station at three\n","o'clock.\" He said, \"No, I'm not coming.\" They told him, \"If you don't come \n","we'll kill you.\" He said, \"Alright, I'll come.\" And he went.\n","\n","They also went to visit my classmate from our microdistrict, Kamo Pogosian. He\n","had also been in prison; I think that together they had either stolen a \n","motorcycle or dismantled one to get some parts they needed. They called him \n","out of his apartment and told him the same thing: \"Tomorrow we're going to get\n","the Armenians. Be there.\" He said, \"No.\" They pulled a knife on him. He said, \n","\"I'm not going all the same.\" And in the courtyard on the 27th they stabbed \n","him several times, in the stomach. He was taken to the hospital. I know he was\n","in the hospital in Baku, in the Republic hospital. If we had known about that \n","we would have had some idea of what was to come on the 28th.\n","\n","I'll return to Grigorian, what he did in our apartment. I remember that he\n","beat me along with all the rest. He spoke Azerbaijani extremely well. But he\n","was very fair-skinned, maybe that led me to think that they had it out for\n","him, too. But later it was proved that he took part in the beating and burning\n","of Shagen Sargisian. I don't know if he participated in the rapes in our \n","apartment; I didn't see, I don't remember. But the people who were in our \n","apartment who didn't yet know that he was an Armenian said that he did. I \n","don't know if he confessed or not, and I myself don't recall because I blacked\n","out very often. But I think that he didn't participate in the rape of Karina\n","because he was in the apartment the whole time. When they carried her into the\n","courtyard, he remained in the apartment.\n","\n","At one point I was talking with an acquaintance about Edik Grigorian. From her\n","I learned that his wife was a dressmaker, his mother is Russian, he doesn't \n","have a father, and that he's been convicted twice. Well this will be his third\n","and, I hope, last sentence. He beat his wife, she was eternally coming to work\n","with bruises. His wife was an Armenian by the name of Rita.\n","\n","The others who were detained . . . well they're little beasts. You really can't\n","call them beasts, they're just little beasts. They were robots carrying out\n","someone else's will, because at the investigation they all said, \"I don't \n","understand how I could have done that, I was out of my head.\" But we know that\n","they were won around to it and prepared for it, that's why they did it. In the\n","name of Allah, in the name of the Koran, in the name of propagating Islam--\n","that's holy to them--that's why they did everything they were commanded to do.\n","Because I saw they didn't have minds of their own, I'm not talking about their\n","level of cultural sophistication or any higher values. No education, they\n","work, have a slew of children without the means to raise them properly, they \n","crowd them in, like at the temporary housing, and apparently, they were \n","promised that if they slaughtered the Armenians they would receive apartments.\n","So off they went. Many of them explained their participation saying, \"they \n","promised us apartments.\"\n","\n","Among them was one who genuinely repented. I am sure that he repented from the\n","heart and that he just despised himself after the incident. He worked at a \n","children's home, an Azerbaijani, he has two children, and his wife works at \n","the children's home too. Everything that they acquired, everything that they \n","have they earned by their own labor, and wasn't inherited from parents or \n","grandparents. And he said, \"I didn't need anything I just don't know . . . how\n","I ended up in that; it was like some hand was guiding me. I had no will of my \n","own, I had no strength, no masculine dignity, nothing.\" And the whole time I\n","kept repeating, \"Now you imagine that someone did the same to your young wife \n","right before your own eyes.\" He sat there and just wailed.\n","\n","But that leader in the Eskimo dogskin coat was not detained. He performed a \n","marvelous disappearing act, but I think that they'll get onto him, they just \n","have to work a little, because that Vadim, that boy, according to his\n","grandfather, is in touch with the young person who taught him what to do, how \n","to cover his tracks. He was constantly exchanging jackets with other boys he \n","knew and those he didn't, either, and other things as well, and changed \n","himself like a chameleon so they wouldn't get onto him, but he was detained.\n","\n","That one in the Eskimo dogskin coat was at the Gambarians' after Aleksandr \n","Gambarian was murdered. He came in and said, \"Let's go, enough, you've spilled\n","enough blood here.\"\n","\n","Maybe Karina doesn't know this but the reason they didn't finish her off was \n","that they were hoping to take her home with them. I heard this from Aunt Tanya\n","and her sons, the Kasumovs, who were in the courtyard near the entryway. They \n","liked her very much, and they had decided to take her to home with them. When \n","Karina came to at one point--she doesn't remember this yet, this the neighbors \n","old me--and she saw that there was no one around her, she started crawling to \n","the entryway. They saw that she was still alive and came back, they were \n","already at the third entryway, on their way to the Gambarians'. They came back\n","and started beating her to finish her. If she had not come to she would have \n","sustained lesser bodily injuries, they would have beat her less. An older \n","woman from our building, Aunt Nazan, an Azerbaijani, all but lay on top of \n","Karina, crying and pleading that they leave her alone, but they flung her off.\n","The woman's grown sons were right nearby; they picked her up in their hands \n","and led her home. She howled and cried out loudly and swore: God is on Earth, \n","he sees everything, and He won't forgive this.\n","\n","There was another woman, too, Aunt Fatima, a sick, aging woman from the first \n","floor, she's already retired. Mountain dwellers, and Azerbaijanis, too, have a\n","custom: If men are fighting, they throw a scarf under their feet to stop them.\n","But they trampled her scarf and sent her home. To trample a scarf is \n","tantamount to trampling a woman's honor.\n","\n","Now that the investigation is going on, now that a lot is behind us and we \n","have gotten back to being ourselves a little, I think about how could these \n","events that are now called the Sumgait tragedy happen? How did they come \n","about? How did it start? Could it have been avoided? Well, it's clear that \n","without a signal, without permission from the top leadership, it would not \n","have happened. All the same, I'm not afraid to say this, the Azerbaijanis,\n","let other worthy people take no offense, the better representatives of their \n","nations, let them take no offense, but the Azerbaijanis in their majority are \n","a people who are kept in line only by fear of the law, fear of retribution for\n","what they have done. And when the law said that they could do all that, like\n","unleashed dogs who were afraid they wouldn't have time to do everything, they \n","threw themselves from one thing to the next so as to be able to get more done,\n","to snatch a bit more. The smell of the danger was already in the air on\n","February 27. You could tell that something was going to happen. And everyone \n","who had figured it out took steps to avoid running into those gangs. Many left\n","for their dachas, got plane tickets for the other end of the country, just got\n","as far away as their legs would carry them.\n","\n","February 27 was a Saturday. I was teaching my third class. The director came \n","into my classroom and said that I should let the children out, that there had \n","been a call from the City Party Committee asking that all teachers gather for \n","a meeting at Lenin Square. Well, I excused the children, and there were few \n","teachers left at school, altogether three women, the director, and six or \n","seven men. The rest had already gone home. We got to Lenin Square and there \n","were a great many people there. This was around five-thirty or six in the \n","evening, no later. They were saying all kinds of rubbish up on the podium and \n","the crowd below was supporting them stormily, roaring. They spoke over the \n","microphone about what had happened in Kafan a few days earlier and that the \n","driver of a bus going to some district had recently thrown a small Azerbaijani\n","child off the bus. The speaker affirmed that he was an eyewitness, that he had\n","seen it himself..The crowd started to rage: \"Death to the Armenians! They must\n","be killed!\" Then a woman went up on stage. I didn't see the woman because \n","people were clinging to the podium like flies. I could only hear her. The \n","woman introduced herself as coming from Kafan, and said that the Armenians \n","cut her daughters' breasts off, and called, \"Sons, avenge my daughters!\" That \n","was enough. A portion of the people on the square took off running in the \n","direction of the factories, toward the beginning of Lenin Street.\n","\n","We stood there about an hour. Then the director of School 25 spoke, he gave a \n","very nationalist speech. He said, \"Brother Muslims, kill the Armenians!\" This \n","he repeated every other sentence. When he said this the crowd supported him \n","stormily, whistling and shouting \"Karabagh!\" He said, \"Karabagh has been our \n","territory my whole life long, Karabagh is my soul. How can you tear out my \n","heart?\" As though an Azerbaijani would die without Karabagh. \"It's our \n","territory, the Armenians will never see it. The Armenians must be eliminated. \n","From time immemorial Muslims have cleansed the land of infidel Armenians, from\n","time immemorial, that's the way nature created it, that every 20 to 30 years \n","the Azerbaijanis should cleanse the land of filth.\" By filth he meant \n","Armenians.\n","\n","I heard this. Before that I hadn't been listening to the speeches closely.\n","Many people spoke and I stood with my back to the podium, talking shop with \n","the other teachers, and somehow it all went right by, it didn't penetrate,\n","that in fact something serious was taking place. Then, when one of our\n","teachers said, \"Listen to what he's saying, listen to what idiocy he's \n","spouting,\" we listened. That was the speech of that director. Before that we \n","listened to the woman's speech.\n","\n","Right then in our group--there were nine of us--the mood changed, and the \n","subject of conversation and all school matters were forgotten. Our director of\n","studies, for whom I had great respect, he's an Azerbaijani . . . Before that I\n","had considered him an upstanding and worthy person, if there was a need to \n","obtain leave we had asked him, he seemed like a good person. So he tells me,\n","\"Lyuda, you know that besides you there are no Armenians on the square? If \n","they find out that you're an Armenian they'll tear you to pieces. Should I \n","tell them you're an Armenian? Should I tell them you're an Armenian?\" When he \n","said it the first time I pretended not to hear it, and then he asked me a \n","second time. I turned to the director, Khudurova, and said that it was already\n","after eight, I was expected at home, and I should be leaving. She answered, \n","\"No, they said that women should stay here until ten o'clock,.and men, until \n","twelve. Stay here.\" There was a young teacher with us, her children were in \n","kindergarten and her husband worked shifts. She asked to leave: \"I left my \n","children at the kindergarten.\" The director excused her. When she let her go I\n","turned around, said, \"Good-bye,\" and left with the young teacher, the \n","Azerbaijani. I didn't see them after that.\n","\n","When we were walking the buses weren't running, and a crowd from the rally ran\n","nearby us. They had apparently gotten all fired up. It must have become too \n","much for them, and they wanted to seek vengeance immediately, so they rushed \n","off. I wasn't afraid this time because I was sure that the other teacher \n","wouldn't say that I was an Armenian.\n","\n","To make it short, we reached home. Then Karina told of how they had been at \n","the movies and what had happened there. I started telling of my experience and\n","again my parents didn't understand that we were in danger. We watched \n","television as usual, and didn't even imagine that tomorrow would be our last \n","day. That's how it all was.\n","\n","At the City Party Committee I met an acquaintance, we went to school together,\n","Zhanna, I don't remember her last name, she lives above the housewares store \n","on Narimanov Street. She was there with her father, for some reason she \n","doesn't have a mother. The two of them were at home alone. While her father \n","held the door she jumped from the third floor, and she was lucky that the \n","ground was wet and that there wasn't anyone behind the building when she went \n","out on the balcony, there was no one there, they were all standing near the \n","entryway. That building was also a lucky one in that there were no murders \n","there. She jumped. She jumped and didn't feel any pain in the heat of the \n","moment. A few days later I found out that she couldn't stand up, she had been \n","injured somehow. That's how people in Sumgait saved their lives, their honor, \n","and their children: any way they could. \n","\n","Where it was possible, the Armenians fought back. My father's first cousin, \n","Armen M., lives in Block 30. They found out by phone from one of the victims \n","what was going on in town. The Armenians in that building all called one \n","another immediately and all of them armed themselves with axes, knives, even \n","with muskets and went up to the roof. They took their infants with them, and \n","their old women who had been in bed for God knows how many months, they got \n","them right out of their beds and took everyone upstairs. They hooked \n","electricity up to the trap door to the roof and waited, ready to fight. Then \n","they took the daughter of the school board director hostage, she's an \n","Azerbaijani who lived in their building. They called the school board director\n","and told her that if she didn't help them, the 17 Armenians on the roof, to \n","escape alive and unharmed, she'd never see her daughter again. I'm sure, of \n","course, that Armenians would never lay a hand on a woman, it was just the only\n","thing that could have saved them at the time. She called the police. The \n","Armenians made a deal with the local police to go into town. Two armored \n","personnel carriers and soldiers were summoned They surrounded the entryway and\n","led everyone down from the roof, and off to the side from the armored \n","personnel carriers was a crowd that was on its way to the building at that \n","very moment, into Block 30. That's how they defended themselves.\n","\n","I heard that our neighbors, Roman and Sasha Gambarian, resisted. They're big, \n","strong guys. Their father was killed. And I heard that the brothers put up a \n","strong defense and lost their father, but were able to save their mother.\n","\n","One of the neighbors told me that after it happened, when they were looking \n","for the criminals on March 1 to 2 and detaining everyone they suspected, \n","people hid people in our entryway, maybe people who were injured or perhaps \n","dead. The neighbors themselves were afraid to go there, and when they went \n","with the soldiers into our basement they are supposed to have found \n","Azerbaijani corpses. I don't know how many. Even if they had been wounded and \n","put down there, after two days they would have died from loss of blood or \n","infection--that basement was filled with water. I heard this from the \n","neighbors. And later when I was talking with the investigators the subject \n","came up and they confirmed it. I know, too, that for several hours the \n","basement was used to store objects stolen from our apartment. And our neighbor\n","carried out our carpet, along with the rest: he stole it for himself, posing \n","as one of the criminals. Everyone was taking his own share, and the neighbor \n","took his, too, and carried it home. And when we came back, when everything \n","seemed to have calmed down, he returned it, saying that it was the only thing \n","of ours he had managed to \"save.\"\n","\n","Raya's husband and father defended themselves. The Trdatovs defended \n","themselves, and so did other Armenian families. To be sure there were\n","Azerbaijani victims, although we'll never hear anything about them. For some \n","reason our government doesn't want to say that the Armenians were not just \n","victims, but that they defended the honor of their sisters and mothers, too. \n","In the TV show \"Pozitsiya\" [Viewpoint] a military man, an officer, said that \n","the Armenians did virtually nothing to defend themselves. But that's not \n","important, the truth will come out regardless.\n","\n","So that's the price we paid those three days. For three days our courage, our \n","bravery, and our humanity was tested. It was those three days, and not the \n","years and dozens of years we had lived before them, that showed what we've \n","become, what we grew up to be. Those three days showed who was who.\n","\n","On that I will conclude my narrative on the Sumgait tragedy. It should be said\n","that it's not over yet, the trials are still ahead of us, and the punishments\n","received by those who so violated us, who wanted to make us into nonhumans \n","will depend on our position and on the work of the investigators, the \n","Procuracy, and literally of every person who lent his hand to the investiga-\n","tion. That's the price we paid to live in Armenia, to not fear going out on \n","the street at night, to not be afraid to say we're Armenians, and to not fear\n","speaking our native tongue.\n","\n","   October 15,1988\n","   Yerevan\n","\n","\t\t\t- - - reference for #008 - - -\n","\n","[1] _The Sumgait Tragedy; Pogroms against Armenians in Soviet Azerbaijan,\n","    Volume I, Eyewitness Accounts_, edited by Samuel Shahmuradian, forward by\n","    Yelena Bonner, 1990, published by Aristide D.

The SK theater. They were showing an Argentinian film, \"The Abyss.\" \n","Before the film we noticed about 60 to 70 people standing near the podium at \n","the City Party Committee, but they were silent, there's no conversation \n","whatsoever, and we couldn't figure out what was going on. That is, we knew it \n","was about Karabagh, but what it was exactly, what they were talking about, if \n","someone gave a speech or not, we didn't know. We bought our tickets. There \n","were 30 or 40 people in the theater. This was a very small number for that \n","large movie theater. The film started. About 30 minutes later they stopped the\n","film. A crowd burst in. About 60 people. They came up onto the stage. Well \n","mostly they were young people, from 16 to 23 years old. They demanded that an \n","Armenian woman come up onto the stage. They used foul language and said that \n","they were going to show what Azerbaijanis were capable of, what they could do \n","to Armenian girls. I thought that's what they meant because they had demanded \n","a girl specifically. Marina and I were sitting together. I told her to move \n","over, there were some Russian girls sitting nearby. So that if someone \n","recognized me or if something happened, they would take me, and not Marina. \n","It got quiet, 2 or 3 girls jumped up to run out, but the door was closed--it's\n","only opened at the end of the   show--and they returned to their seats. \n","Everyone in the theater was looking at one another, Russians, Azerbaijanis, \n","people of various nationalities. But no one reacted at all, no one in the \n","auditorium made a sound. They were silent, looking at one another, and \n","gradually started to leave. Some guy, a really fat one, says, \"OK, we've \n","scared them enough, let's leave.\" They leave slowly, pompously. It seemed to \n","me that those people were not themselves. Either they had smoked a bunch of \n","\"anasha\", or had taken something else, because they all looked beastly, like \n","they were ready to tear anyone apart. Then it was all over, as though nothing \n","had happened at all. The film started up again, it was one of those cheerful \n","films which should have only brought pleasure, made you happy to be alive. We \n","could barely sit to the end. So it had started at seven it was over by nine, \n","and it was dark . . .\n","\n","Marina and I were walking home, Lenin Street, that's the center of town. Lenin\n","Street was packed, just packed with young people. They were shouting, \n","something about Karabagh and something about Armenians. We weren't especially \n","listening, because the way we were feeling we didn't know if we were going to \n","make it home or not, and just what had happened anyway? Public transportation \n","wasn't running. Incidentally, when we came out of the theater we saw police, \n","policemen standing there. The director of the movie theater was looking at the\n","doors, because when they were leaving they had broken the glass, the doors \n","there are basically all glass. Everything was broken. He stood there grief-\n","stricken, but looking as though nothing really big had happened, like some \n","naughty boys had just broken them quite by accident, with a slingshot. Well, \n","since he looked more or less calm I decided that, nothing all that super \n","serious had happened. We went out very slowly; we wanted to catch a bus, we \n","live literally one stop away. We didn't want to go on foot, not because it was\n","dark, but because something might happen. We flagged down a cab, but the \n","driver didn't want to take us. We told him we live near the bus station, and \n","he said he'd take us to the bus station and not a yard farther. I said, well, \n","OK . . .\n","\n","So we got into the cab and managed to get there. Something incredible was \n","happening at the bus station. There was a traffic jam. Public transportation \n","was at a standstill and everyone was shouting \"Ka-ra-bagh,\" they're not going \n","to give up Karabagh. I go home and tell my family what's going on, and there's\n","immediate panic in the house. Mamma says, what should we do? Like the end had \n","come, they were going to come, kill us, that's it . . . Somehow we managed to \n","cheer ourselves up: Nothing that bad could happen. Where are we living anyway,\n","just what kind of social order do we have? Somehow we manage to calm Mamma \n","down. And we went to bed. But no one could sleep. Everyone made as though \n","nothing had happened.\n","\n","That was on Saturday. In short, the day went by. We didn't go anywhere and \n","didn't call our relatives. No one did anything. Because . . . life goes on.\n","That day I realized something was approaching, but what exactly, I couldn't\n","guess.\n","\n","On the 28th everything was like it was supposed to be, we lived like we always\n","had. There were five of us at home: Mamma, Papa and us, three sisters: Lyuda, \n","Marina, and I. My sister Lyuda was in Yerevan at the time. We sat at home and \n","no one went out. Later we learned that a demonstration had started that \n","morning. It all started . . . They were smashing up stores. We were sitting at\n","home and didn't know anything about it. Then a girlfriend of mine, Lyuda \n","Zimogliad, came by at around three o'clock I think. We worked together, we did\n","our apprenticeships together, she's a Russian girl. She said that something\n","awful was happening in town. I asked, \"Don't they want Armenians? Well what \n","are they after, if they're already in that state?\" She says, no, nothing like \n","that, it's just a demonstration, but it's awful to watch it. Somehow, it feels\n","like a war has broken out. Public transportation has been stopped . . . The \n","cabs, the buses, well it's just a nightmare.\n","\n","Then Papa decides to go to the drugstore, my mother was having allergy \n","problems at the time . . . He left the house and our neighbor, Aunt Vera,\n","asked him, \"Where are you going? Stop! There are such terrible things going\n","on in the courtyard; aren't you afraid to go out?\" Papa didn't know what she\n","was talking about. She simply pushed him back into the entryway. He came home \n","and told Mamma. Mamma said, \"Well, if Aunt Vera was talking like that it means\n","that something is really going on.\" But we didn't go see her, she's a Russian,\n","she lives across from us. I had to see my friend out. Around five o'clock I \n","tell Lyuda, \"Ok, look, it's time for you to go, it's late already, I'll see \n","you out.\" Mamma says, \"You don't need to go, it's too late already, you can \n","see what the situation in town is.\" So we decided to stay home. Dinner was \n","ready. Mamma says, \"Let her eat with us, then she can go.\" We sat down at the \n","table. But no one was hungry, no one was in the mood, we just put everything \n","out on the table to calm ourselves down, and make it appear that we're eating.\n","We turned on the television, and the show \"In Fairy-Tale Land\" was coming on. \n","We cleared the table.\n","\n","We hear some noise out in the courtyard. I go out on the balcony, but I can't \n","see what's going on, because the noise is coming from the direction of the bus\n","station, and there is a 9-story building in the way. There is mob of people \n",". . . I can't figure out what's happening. They're shouting something, looking\n","somewhere, I can't make out what is going on. I go down to a neighbor, she's \n","an Azerbaijani; we've been friends of her family for about 25 years. I go down\n","to look from their place. I see people shouting, looking at the 5-and 9-story \n","buildings near the bus station. Just then soldiers set upon them, about 20 \n","people, with clubs. The mob runs off in different directions. I even see \n","several people from our building. They are looking and laughing . . . I decide\n","that means it's not all that bad if they are laughing: it means they're not \n","killing anyone. But now the crowd suddenly dashes toward the soldiers. One of \n","the soldiers cannot manage to get away, they start stomping on him with their \n","feet, everyone's kicking him . . . I become ill and go home, and explain in \n","general terms that horrible things are going on out there . . .  can't speak\n",". . . Well, they've probably killed that soldier, the way that crowd is . . .\n","If each of them kicked him just once . . . They took his club away from him\n","and started to beat him with it. But it was far away and I couldn't see if he\n","got up and left or not.\n","\n","I become terrified and go home and say, \"Lyuda, don't go anywhere, stay at our\n","place, because if you go out they could kill you or . . . \" Then the crowd \n","runs over closer toward our building and stands at the 12-story building and \n","starts shouting something. We go out onto the balcony. All of our neighbors \n","are also out on theirs, too. Everyone is standing, staring. The mob is \n","shouting and about 5 minutes later comes running toward our building. As it \n","turns out, at the 12-story building the Azerbaijani neighbors went down and \n","kept them from coming in. There's only one entryway there, they could stop \n","them.\n","\n","They all run up to our building. Mamma immediately starts closing the windows,\n","afraid that they might throw stones. They have stones and they break the \n","windows, all of them. There are very many people. We have a large courtyard, \n","and it's packed with people. They spill up to the first floor so they don't \n","crush each other. They crawl up on trees, posts, and garages. It's just a huge\n","cloud of people. They break and burn the motorcycle of the Armenian Sergey \n","Sargisian, from our building. We close the windows and immediately hear \n","tramping in our entryway. They come up to our fifth floor with a tremendous \n","din and roar. It's incomprehensible. Mamma told me later that they were \n","shouting Father's name, \"Grisha, open the door, we've come to kill you!,\" or\n","something like that. I don't remember that, I was spaced out, kind of. Mamma \n","says, \"Into the bedroom, quickly!\" In the bedroom we have two tall beds, part \n","of our dowry; Mamma says, \"Hide there, they probably won't come in there, \n","they'll ask something, say something, and leave.\" She says, \"We'll tell them \n","that we live alone here.\" I can't imagine that my parents will stand out in \n","the hall alone talking with some sort of beasts . . . I go to them and say \n","that I'll stand together with them, I'll talk with them if they come, maybe I \n","can find a common language with them, all the more so if they know me: I speak \n","Azerbaijani more or less, and I can find out what they want. I told Marina and\n","Lyuda to hide under the bed, and my sister Lyuda, I can't remember if I told \n","her anything or not.\n","\n","Then . . . they open the door: it's like they blew on it and it broke and fell\n","right into the hall. The crows bursts in and starts to shout: Get out of here,\n","leave, vacate the apartment and go back to your Armenia; things like that. I\n","tell them, \"What has happened, speak calmly. One of you, tell me, calmly, what\n","has happened.\" In Azerbaijani, they say, \"Get out of the apartment, leave.\" I \n","say, \"OK. Go downstairs. We'll gather everything we need and leave the \n","apartment.\" I realize that it is senseless to discuss any sort of rights with\n","them, these are animals. They must be stopped. The ones standing in the\n","doorway, the young guys, say, \"There are old people and one girl with them.\n","Too bad!\" They take two or three steps back. It seems as though I have\n","pacified them with our exchange. Then someone in the courtyard shouts, \n","commanding them: \"Don't you understand what you are saying? Kill them?\"\n","\n","And that was it! That was all it took. They grab Papa, carry him into one\n","room, and Mamma and me into another. They put Mamma on the bed and start \n","undressing her, beating her legs. They start tearing my clothes, right there, \n","in front of Mamma. I don't remember where they went, what they did, or how \n","much time passed. I had the feeling that they beat me on the head, on my body,\n","and tore my clothes, all at the same time, I don't even know what I said. The \n","atrocities started. I was savagely raped in that room. They argued among \n","themselves who would go first.\n","\n","Later, I remember, I came to. I don't know if I'm dead or alive. Someone comes\n","in, someone tall, I think, clean-shaven, in an Eskimo dogskin coat, balding. \n","He looks around at what's happening. At that instant everything stops. It \n","seems to me that he is either their commander or . . . that somehow everything\n","depends on him. He looks and says, \"Well, we're done here.\" They are beating\n","Mamma on the head. They break up the chairs and beat her with the chair legs \n",". . . She loses consciousness, and they decide that she's dead. Papa . . . was\n","out cold. They want to throw Lyuda off the balcony, but they can't get the \n","window open. Apparently the window frames are stuck after the rain and the \n","windows can't be opened. They leave her next to the window. She was thinking \n","about being thrown out the window and passed out. She's not a real strong \n","person anyway . . . He looks at me and sees that I'm saying something, that\n","I'm still twitching. Well, I start saying the opposite of what I should be, \n","which is humbling myself and pleading. I start shouting, cursing . . . they \n","don't get any entreaty out of me. I  already know that I'm dead, why would I \n","humble myself before anyone? And he says that if that's what I think, since my\n","tongue is so long . . . maybe he thinks that I still look quite appealing \n",". . . In short, he commands that I be taken outside.\n","\n","I no longer saw or remembered what was happening to Marina and Lyuda, I don't \n","know if they are alive or not. They take me outside. They are dragging me by \n","my arms, by my legs. They are hitting me against the wall, the railings, \n","something metal . . . While they are carrying me someone is biting me, someone\n","else is pinching me . . .I don't even know. I think, my God, when will death \n","come? If only it were sooner . . . Then . . . they carry me out, throw me near\n","the entryway . . . and start kicking me. I lose consciousness . . . What \n","happened after that, how many people there were, I don't remember.\n"," \n","I come to after a while, I don't remember how long. A neighbor is bringing me \n","clothing. I'm entirely covered with blood, she puts a dress on me. I remember \n","that I said the same words over and over again: \"Mamma, what happened, Mamma, \n","what have they done to us, where are we, whose house are we at?\" I can't make \n","sense out of anything. There is a guy standing over me, I sort of know him, he\n","served in Afghanistan, his name is Igor, he brought me indoors. When they all \n","went to the third entryway and killed a person there, Igor gathered his \n","courage, took me into his arms, and brought me to the neighbors', even though \n","he's small-minded, he put himself at risk. Igor Agayev is Azerbaijani; he \n","served in Afghanistan. There are three brothers. The older brother also served\n","there, I think; now he's stationed here, on the border, in Armenia. Igor \n","brought me to the neighbors', and then helped me come to my senses, saying, \n","\"Karina, I know you, calm down, I'm not one of them.\" How do I know who's who \n","and what's what? I come to, and they clean me up. I was covered in blood. Then\n","Papa . . . I saw Papa, I saw Mamma. And Marina, too . . . Igor was there when \n","they dragged Marina and Lyuda out from under the bed . . . Marina . . . Lyuda \n","said that she was Russian, they said, we'll let you go, we aren't touching the\n","Russians, go. And while they are dragging Marina out she decides she's going \n","to tell them she's Azerbaijani. Igor immediately grabs Marina's and Lyuda's \n","hands, because he knows Marina, and knows that she is Armenian and is our \n","sister, and takes her to the second floor to a neighbor's and starts pounding \n","on the door so she will open up. She opens the door and Igor pushes them in \n","there. So they survived.\n","\n","My sister Lyuda lost consciousness after the bandits started stealing things.\n","While they were going downstairs, taking things downstairs, then coming back \n","up again, Lyuda seized the opportunity and crawled under the bed and stayed \n","there. Then, when she was herself again, she found a torn night shirt and put \n","it on, and some sort of robe and went to a neighbor's on the fourth floor, the\n","one whose apartment I had watched the crowd from, the friend of ours, and \n","knocked on the door. The neighbor opened and said, \"I'm not going to let you \n","in the apartment because I'm afraid of them. But I'll give you some stockings \n","and we'll leave the building.\" Lyuda says, \"I'll stay at your place because of\n","what's going on, they keep going up and down the stairs.\" It was just for a \n","moment, just a moment in life, but the neighbor wouldn't consent. Lyuda came \n","back to our place and lay under the bed . . .\n","\n","I came to. Mother was there. I can't remember my supervisor's telephone \n","number, but something had to be done. Somehow I remembered and called, and he \n","came to get us. He didn't have any idea what was going on. He thought we were \n","simply afraid, he didn't know that they were killing us and that we had passed\n","between life and death. He came and got us and took us to the police precinct.\n","There they looked us over. I was having trouble walking, my lungs hurt badly, \n","it was hard to breathe . . .\n","\n","My supervisor's name is Urshan Feyruzovich Mamedov. He's the head of our \n","administration. They took us there. When we were leaving, I saw a great number\n","of buses full of soldiers at the entrance to town. The buses were ordinary \n","passenger buses. There were very many soldiers. We left around eleven, right \n","after eleven. If these people could stop what was happening they could save a \n","great many lives . . . Because the crowd was moving on, toward the school, and\n","what was going on there . . . I think everyone know not only in Sumgait, not \n","only in Yerevan. Because there they murdered them all one after the next, \n","without stopping. After us.\n","\n","I think 14 people died in Microdistrict No. 3, and 10 to 12 of them were from\n","Buildings 4, 5, and 6. In our building one person died, and one old woman died\n","from Building 16, that's the building in front of ours. There young \n","Azerbaijani men stopped the mob and wouldn't let it into their building. \n","Incidentally, when we were at the neighbors', Marina called our relatives\n","to warn them, so they would all know what was happening. I called a aunt in \n","Microdistrict No. 5. They have three neighbors who are Armenians. I said, \"Run\n","quickly, I can't explain what's going on; hide, do what you can, just stay\n","alive. Hide at Azerbaijanis', ones who won't give you away.\" At that moment \n","three people came in, policemen. I think they were Azerbaijanis. I was in such\n","awful condition, my face was completely distorted my lips were puffed up, \n","there was blood, my eye was swollen, no one thought I would ever see anything \n","out of that eye again . . . my forehead was badly cut, and one-half of my face\n","was pushed out forward. No one would have thought that I would survive, get my\n","normal appearance back, and be able to grasp anything at all. I started to \n","scream at those people, why did you come, who sent you here, no one wants you \n","here, haven't you killed people people yet, what are you doing here? One of \n","the soldiers said, \"Don't scream at us. We're Muslims, but we're not from the \n","Sumgait police. They called in from Daghestan.\" So at that point the \n","Daghestan police were there.\n","\n","When we got to the police precinct there were an awful lot of police there,\n","there were soldiers, police with dogs, ambulances, firemen . . . I don't know,\n","maybe they were waiting for people to bring them the goners and the seriously \n","injured to treat them there in the police precinct. I don't know what they \n","were there for. There were also doctors from Baku there. They examined Lyuda \n","and me and said, \"These women need to go to the Maternity Home, but we don't \n","know what to do with the rest.\"\n","\n","So they took us, and I lost contact with my parents, my boss, everyone. My \n","boss said, \"Don't worry, I'll find you, no matter where you are, no matter\n","what happens.\" We went to the hospital. There we were examined by a department\n","head from the Sumgait Maternity Home, Pashayeva, I think her name was. She \n","examined us. The ambulance was from Baku; I figured out that the Sumgait \n","ambulances hadn't done anything, they didn't respond to any calls. People \n","called and neither the police nor the ambulances showed any sign of life.\n","\n","That doctor looked me over and I could tell from her behavior that something\n","very good had happened, for she became quite glad. I even thought to myself, \n","\"God, can it be that nothing all that bad is wrong?\" She looks me over and \n","says, \"Now why are you suffering so? You don't know what your people have been\n","doing, your people did even worse things.\" And I think, great, I have to deal \n","with her . . . And I felt so bad, I thought, why don't I just die so as not to\n","have to hear more stuff like this from people like her? Here I am in this \n","condition and being told about something that our people did. I just didn't \n","have the energy to say, \"How could our people possibly be smart enough to \n","think of something that yours haven't already done?\" I stayed there. Then they\n","brought in another woman, Ira B., she was married, and she was raped in her \n","own apartment, too. There were three of us, Ira, Lyuda, and 1. The next \n","morning they took Lyuda and Ira away. They didn't do anything to help us. This\n","was in the old Maternity Home, in the combined block. They didn't do anything \n","more than examine me, that was it. I didn't want any shots or tranquilizer, \n","nothing. What shots could have calmed me down? I didn't even want to look at \n","them.\n","\n","I lay in the ward. Either it just worked out that way or they did it on pur-\n","pose, but I was alone. I was alone even though the wards were packed. That\n","same evening a woman came by and asked me what was wrong with me, that my face\n","was disfigured. She asked what had happened to me, and I said, \"Better to ask \n","your brother what happened, there's no point in asking me, your brother can \n","better explain what happened.\" She fell into a faint. All the doctors threw \n","themselves at her, and the doctor categorically forbade anyone to come into my\n","ward.\n","\n","Then people from work came to see me, my boss, his daughter; they brought me \n","clothing, because I was literally naked. The only thing I had on was a dress, \n","but the woman who gave it to me was very short, and the dress was way up \n","above my knees, and the woman orderly said, \"I can't believe you put on such a\n","short dress, who are you showing off your legs to here?\" I went back to my \n","ward thinking, just one more thing from something. People from work came and \n","brought me something in a sack, apples, I think, three or four pounds, but I \n","couldn't take them. I had become so weak that it was just embarrassing. I said\n","that I couldn't take the apples, and really didn't have any appetite. No one \n","had to bring me anything. Some woman took the sack . . . And, oh yes! . . . \n","Then I heard that the head doctor tell a nurse that my medical history should \n","be hidden or torn up completely so that no one would know that I was an \n","Armenian, maybe they wouldn't figure it out from looking at me. So they must \n","have been thinking that there would be some kind of attack, that something \n","else would happen. That it would be worse. Or, perhaps, someone was outside on\n","the street, I don't know. In any case, I didn't sleep a wink that night.\n","\n","The next morning they picked me up, a whole police detail, put me in a bus, \n","and off we went. I didn't even know where they were taking me. They took me to\n","the club where the troops were, the very one I was in that ill-fated evening.\n","I got off the bus. Near the City Party Committee there were a great many \n","troops, tanks, armored personnel carriers; the whole scene was terrible. I saw \n","a few people I knew there, and that calmed me a little. I had already thought \n","that I was the only one left. So there were five or six of us left in Sumgait \n","after that night. I still didn't know what happened to my parents, they didn't \n","come to see me in the hospital, and my boss told me that everything was fine. \n","I didn't know whether to believe him or not. Maybe he was just trying to calm \n","me down, maybe something happened on the way. Then I went to the club and saw \n","a lot of people I knew. They all knew one another, they were all kissing each \n","other and asking, \"What happened, what went on?\" Two days later they came to \n","see me from work. They were there all the time. Each day they came, showed \n","interest, and were constantly bringing me money. They did everything they \n","could. Of course I'm most thankful to my boss, the only one of my colleagues \n","who didn't lose his presence of mind and who didn't change his opinions, \n","neither before, nor after, nor in the heat of the moment, no matter what \n","happened. He constantly took an interest. A sincere interest, from the heart \n",". . . Then, about two days later, the secretary of the Party Committee came, \n","not from our Party organization, but from the First Trust, which ours is part \n","of, Comrade Kerimov, a very important figure in our town. He made arrangements\n","with the emergency medical personnel to take me away, because if I sat down by\n","myself I couldn't get up or lie down again. There was something wrong with my\n","lungs, it was hard to breathe. They examined me there several times, there I \n","lay were several doctors, they all thought that . . . that it must just be \n","from all the blows, I don't know. They didn't diagnose anything in particular.\n","When I was in the Maternity Home I even asked . . . I made it a point of \n","insisting that they take me to the trauma section because I felt so awful. \n","There was no way something inside wasn't broken, my ribs . . . Well they took \n","me there and took x-rays and said that everything was fine. There were \n","emergency medical workers on duty in the club. The mother of one of Marina's \n","friends was there. She was the head doctor at the Sumgait Children's Clinic. \n","They had every kind of antifever agent in the world, which was exactly what I\n","needed at that moment, I thought. I said that I was having great difficulty\n","breathing, I couldn't seem to get enough air, something was wrong with me.\n","They put tight bandages around my chest and waist. Later I overheard some\n","people saying that I had been cut all over. I think they just saw me being all\n","bandaged up and decided that my breasts and face had been cut . . . But I\n","wasn't cut.\n","\n","They took us to the Khimik boarding house. We lived there a long time. Soon \n","appeared representatives . . . They were agitating. At first people would not \n","talk to them, and drove them off. One of the Armenian women shouted, \"We \n","demand that Seidov come!\" The response was, \"It's Seidov who sent us.\" Seidov \n","is the Chairman of the Azerbaijani Council of Ministers. The woman said, \n","\"We'll only see Seidov's daughter, have her come here, we'll do the same \n","things to her that they did to our daughters, and then we'll deal with you \n","agitators.\" And so on. More of them said, \"Have Seidov himself come.\" This \n","went on day in, day out. The agitators kept coming and coming, this drove us \n","out of our wits. Then people gradually started departing for Yerevan because \n","they realized it was senseless to stay. Everything got on our nerves: The \n","smell, the small children. There were children at the SK club, children who \n","had literally just come out of the Maternity Home. What were they doing in a \n","club that didn't even have running water all the time? At first we had to pay \n","to eat there. They even overcharged us, as it turned out. On the second day \n","someone told us that they would bring us food for free. The children were ill.\n","Everything stank there. Well imagine about 3,000 people in a small movie \n","theater with seating for no more than 500. You couldn't sit or lie down, it \n","was impossible to even move. The stench was awful. Even the smallest infants \n","took ill overnight there. I heard that they were arriving seriously ill in \n","Yerevan, the infants. They have to be washed, they have to be bathed, not to \n","mention that we, the adults, were ill and needed care. People were fainting \n","right and left. I just don't know, everyone was crying, everyone . . . Only \n","the young people, the men, somehow managed to keep it together. But the women \n","were in a constant state of panic. It seemed to everyone that they would come \n","any minute and kill and stab. It seemed clear that we had been gathered \n","together purposely, like during the war, so that they could burn the movie \n","theater and there wouldn't be a single Armenian left. Then people went up to \n","the attic. I didn't see them, I only heard them, because I was lying down and \n","couldn't get up. I lay right on the stage, we had some room there. Apparently \n","they caught two people with either oil or gas. I think they wanted to burn the\n","theater. Maybe someone saw them, I didn't. I was in no condition to open my \n","eyes.\n","\n","Everyone was suspicious of everyone else. They would ask, \"Aren't you an \n","Azerbaijani? I think I saw you somewhere, I think you're an Azerbaijani.\" They\n","led out all the men and started letting them back in by checking their\n","passports, relatives might be covering for each other. Half of the people did\n","not have any documents. There were people who had run out of their homes in \n","nothing but a pair of pants and slippers, or wearing just a shirt, not like\n","they should have, with their IDs.\n","\n","So on the 28th, on Sunday, I think, the police did nothing to help us. On\n","Monday everything resumed where it had left off on Block 41A. They didn't \n","spare a soul there: not children, not pregnant women, nobody. They killed,\n","they burned, they hacked with axes, just everything possible. They murdered \n","the Melkumian family whom I knew, my mother worked with them. Their daughter-\n","in-law went to school with my older sister. They were brutally murdered. Only \n","the two daughters-in-law survived. By a miracle one was able to save herself, \n","she ran away, the neighbors wouldn't take her in, so she ran about the \n","building until she found refuge. She was pregnant and had two small children. \n","This all continued on Monday in Block 41A, on the 29th, when the troops were \n","already in the city.\n","\n","They murdered people, they overturned automobiles, and they burned entire \n","families. They say they didn't even know for sure if the people were Armenians\n","or not. I heard that the Lezgins suffered, too. I'm not sure myself, I didn't \n","see any Lezgins who had been injured. They burned cars so it's very difficult \n","now to say exactly who died and who didn't. It was very difficult to identify \n","the corpses, or rather, what remained of the corpses after they were doused in\n","gasoline and burned . . . it's all very hard to imagine, of course I heard \n","that many people disappeared without a trace, from the BTZ plant two people, \n","including a woman who worked the night shift, Aunt Razmella, who also lived in\n","Microdistrict 3.\n","\n","They were stopping buses between Baku and Sumgait. In the evening people who \n","had been visiting Baku were returning to Sumgait, and people from Baku were \n","going home from Sumgait, and there were students, too. They were simply \n","savagely murdered. They were stopping the buses, the drivers immediately did \n","what they were told because there was just no other way to deal with that \n","hoard of brutally minded people. They stopped the buses, dragged the Armenians\n","out and killed them on the spot. I didn't see it myself, but I heard that they\n","put them all in a pile so as to burn them. Later it was hard to discern from \n","the corpses, well you can't call them corpses, you had to figure out from the \n","ashes who it was. l heard that two fellows saved two women, one a student, Ira\n","G., if I'm not mistaken. She was in the hospital a long time after that, and \n","she still can't figure out who saved her. She was also brutally raped and \n","beaten and thrown onto a pile of corpses. The fellow pulled her out of that \n","whole pile of corpses, put his coat on her, took her into his arms, and \n","carried her to the city. I still can't imagine how he managed to do that.\n","\n","I heard that from Engels Grigorian. He knows her, apparently. Well a lot of \n","people went to that hospital anyway. She was in the hospital and singing a \n","song in Armenian, and they wrote the words down, and, I think he still has \n","that piece of paper, because he says that a lot of people now have that song, \n","the one she sang in the hospital where she lay in such bad shape. They \n","couldn't find the guy who saved her. He left her in someone's apartment and\n","called the ambulance, she was in such awful shape that, probably, like me,\n","she couldn't remember anyone's face.\n","\n","I think that I knew one of the people who broke into our house, maybe I had \n","talked with him once. But I received so many blows everything was just knocked\n","out of my head. I can't remember to this day who he was. Then, it seems, I saw\n","the Secretary of the Directorate's Party organization, where Marina works. She\n","goes to school and works, she goes to night school at AZI, and works by day at\n","the Khimzashchita Construction and Installation Administration. I'm the \n","Secretary of the Komsomol organization at our administration and often met \n","with the secretaries of Party and Komsomol organizations. We had joint \n","meetings. I know them all, I've even talked with them, and he, I know, is from\n","Armenia. An Azerbaijani, but from Armenia. It became obvious that many of \n","those people were Azerbaijanis born in Armenia.\n","\n","They took me to various police stations, to the police precinct, and to the\n","Procuracy, because the USSR Procuracy got involved in the case, and I iden-\n","tified the photographs of people who I could more or less recognize. They\n","showed me the people who were in our apartment, they're working on our\n","case, but I can't even recognize them, although it was proved that they were\n","the ones, they're processing it somehow. They tell me that they know that\n","someone held me by the arm and someone else held me by the leg when they were \n","dragging me. There was someone else in our apartment who did not even touch \n","me, he just stole a blanket and an earring or something like that. All these \n","people, all of them, as much as I've heard about them and seen them, they were\n","all from Kafan.\n","\n","The Secretary of the Party organization is named Najaf, Najaf Rzayev. He was \n","there when everything started. It must have been him because I didn't \n","recognize anyone else in the crowd whom I knew besides him. All the more since\n","I told him, \"Listen, you do something, because you know me.\" He turned away \n","and went toward the bedroom, where Marina was. Well you couldn't see Marina \n","anyway. There was such a noisy confusion of people that you couldn't make out \n","anyone. All of it flew right out of my head, and then gradually I became \n","myself again, at the City Party Committee . . . There were military people \n","there. I told them what went on, and they wrote it all down. I told them his \n","name. On March 8 the Secretary of our First Trust Party organization, the one \n","we're part of, came to see us, his name is Najaf Rzayev. I tell Mamma, \"If\n","he's here despite the fact that I gave his name, it means that either his \n","alibi has been confirmed or, probably, that they think I'm crazy, not \n","responsible for my words.\" He said, \"What did they do to you, how awful, \n","myself, I hid an Armenian family.\" Then after some time goes by he comes back \n","again and says something entirely different: \"I wasn't at home, my family and \n","I went to Baku.\" I said, \"Marina, what is he saying? He said something totally\n","different before.\" After that I didn't go to see our Procurator, our case is \n","being handled by a procurator from Voronezh, Fedorov by name. Fedorov told me \n","that Rzayev's case had just gotten to him, and there were so names involved. \n","What are they doing with Rzayev?\n","Did he prove his alibi or not? They just think that since I was hit in the \n","head I can't say anything for sure, whether it was him or not. It will be an \n","insult if he was in our apartment and doesn't have to pay for it, but at the \n","same time\n","\n","I'm afraid to say I'm a hundred percent sure that it was he. Because no mat-\n","ter who I name, they tell me, no, you're wrong, he didn't do that, that one\n","wasn't there. All the faces have gotten mixed up in my mind. Who did what\n","exactly I can't say.                                                     \n","\n","When they took me outside there was a whole crowd there, but I didn't see it, \n","because I had my eyes closed all the time. It seemed to me that I always got\n","it because of my eyes, people were always hassling me, for some reason it \n","always seemed to me that my eyes are responsible. When they were beating my \n","face I thought they were trying to put my eyes out. So I had my eyes closed, \n","they took me outside and started to beat me. A young guy, 22, held my arms, he\n","works at the BTZ plant. And right nearby, across the road from us, Block 41, \n","is where all this was going on. Right across the road from us. The BTZ \n","dormitory is over there, that's where he lives. Now he's in custody, they even\n","have proved, as far as I know, that it was he who killed Shurik Gambarian, the\n","clarinet player from the third entryway of our building. One person in our \n","building was killed, it was that man.\n","\n","A guy comes by who shared a room with the guy who was holding me. He saw that\n","he was holding me by the arms and that he was beating me, but he didn't come \n","over, he just looked and then went into the dormitory. A while after it was \n","all over, people started making announcements in town saying that \n","investigators had been summoned. That guy went and told them everything. Now \n","they've caught him, everything's been proved. Now, evidently, they've been\n","beating him, I don't know what they're doing with them over there, but he \n","himself said that he was working the night shift at the plant. Some young guy \n","came to the plant and said, \"Everyone who wants to kill Armenians come to the \n","bus station on Saturday at ten.\" That was it. He said, the ones who wanted to,\n","went. This was at the BTZ plant, during the night shift, probably, late Friday\n","night. It was at night, they were at the sauna together. And he said, what do \n","you mean, do you understand what you are saying? The others were silent, \n","probably, in their hearts they were thinking, I'm going to go. But they didn't\n","say anything to one another. He said that he thought it important to to go, \n","because he had heard a lot about what had happened in Kafan, that they had \n","killed their Azerbaijani sisters, their mothers, burned villages, and all of \n","that. That guy was also born in Kafan. That is certain. And Marina says that \n","the Secretary of the Party organization is from Armenia, too.                                                             from\n","\n","I've participated in the investigation a couple of times. I'm satisfied with\n","them thus far. They summoned us and asked about what happened, and every word \n","I said was recorded. I met some guy there . . . By the way, he was an \n","Armenian. I said that he was in our apartment, but what he did, I don't know. \n","His last name was Grigorian, Eduard Grigorian. He s from Sumgait, from \n","Microdistrict 1. He was sentenced I think, to five years, not his first time. \n","His mother is Russian. I met with him at the KGB in Baku, at the Azerbaijani \n","KGB. They took us there and showed me photographs. There were so many \n","photographs, I think they even photographed those people who were caught at \n","curfew, and I've got them all confused. I say, the face was about like this, \n","the guy in the white coat with the red clasps. But he could take that coat off\n","and burn it somewhere, and it would be like looking for a needle in a \n","haystack. Well. This guy, Grigorian, I said, he was in our apartment, but he \n","is so light-complected that he looks like a Lezgin. I don't know what he did, \n","I can't remember. Maybe he beat me or raped me. But he was in our apartment. \n","At the KGB he started asking me, pleading with me, there's no need for this, \n","all this stuff, look me in the eyes, you're like a sister to me. I took a look\n","at him and thought, \"My God, Heaven forbid that I should have a brother like \n","you.\" But they were satisfied with my responses, because I said everything \n","without great certainty. I was there with Mamma. Then Lyuda came in, but when \n","she came in she got sick immediately. She wanted to kill him, she crawled over\n","the table at him. She recognized him. When she came to, Lyuda was lying on the\n","balcony, the mob threw her there and all of them ran into the bedroom. We had \n","all kinds of boxes with dishes in them, the dowries for all three sisters. \n","They stole everything in the apartment, leaving only small things. At that \n","moment Lyuda came to and started remembering everything. Well, seeing the \n","faces, hearing the voices . . . Two people were saying they could burn the \n","apartment. Another says, why burn the apartment when I've got three kids and \n","no place to live. So this guy was in temporary housing, he didn't have \n","anywhere to live, he was from Sumgait. They were sure that they would get the \n","apartment. Besides, the neighbors were Azerbaijani. Why should they burn the \n","apartment, they might burn Azerbaijanis. That's what they said. How did they \n","know there were Azerbaijanis there, if they just picked a place, thinking that\n","Armenians lived there? We have a list of the residents for our part of the \n","building, our name is in there, but how could they know that Azerbaijanis \n","lived on the other side of the wall from us? So they didn't set fire to our \n","apartment.\n","\n","I don't know, I was in such bad shape that if all of it had come to a halt \n","when I was outside, if someone had asked me what was happening, I would\n","have said that a civil war was going on. Well, maybe not civil . . . but\n","probably civil, because when they were beating me I opened my eyes and saw\n","that all the neighbors were standing on their balconies and watching, like at\n","a free horror film. So a civil war was going on, and only the Armenians were\n","being fought. If it were a world war or something like that, they would have\n","been fighting everyone. But they only fought us. Then I met some women from \n","our building, some Azerbaijanis. They are crying, they tell me, \"Karina, we \n","saw all of it, how could it happen?\" They're asking me! Well I just don't know\n","what to call it if a normal girl can stand there and watch what happened to \n","me. I think that if it were the other way around either I wouldn't have been \n","able to take it, or I would have tried to avert it, like that one Azerbaijani \n","woman did in front of our building. A woman lives there, an awful, dissipated \n","woman, if you can call her a woman, the dissipated life she leads. Two \n","Armenian families live there, in her part of the building. She came out on the\n","balcony and saw what was happening to me and started to scream and curse. She \n","came down to the entryway and said, \"You'll come in this entryway over my dead\n","body.\" So not one of them took it in his head to go in that entryway. Some \n","folks were saying that those people were so out of control that they didn't \n","even know what they were doing. I don't think that's true. They knew very well\n","what they were doing if they didn't even lift a hand against that woman. They \n","couldn't have cared less about her, but the fact that she was an Azerbaijani \n","stopped them.\n","\n","They were just beasts, they had smoked so much. When they came to our place \n","they were all chewing something. I noticed: Everyone who came into the \n","apartment was chewing something. I think, my God, maybe I just think that? \n","Maybe I'm losing my mind? But no, they're all chewing something. Maybe it is \n","some kind of drug, it must be, because . . . At first glance they all seemed \n","to be such normal people, young, clean-shaven, looking exactly as if they had \n","come to some sort of celebration. But they were shouting something. They\n","didn't talk, they shouted, as though there were deaf people there. They \n","screamed and screamed: \"Yeah, killing, killing, we're killing the Armenians!\" \n","Only they didn't shout \"kill,\" they shouted \"gurun ermianlary.\" Gurun \n","literally means \"kill,\" or \"destroy.\"\n","\n","That's how it was! I'll continue. We hid in a captain's apartment, he's an\n","Azerbaijani, his wife is a Tatar. We were sitting in their apartment, their \n","kids were out in the yard. Their kids knew a whole lot. This was in our part \n","of the building, on the third floor. When Mamma came to and couldn't find\n","Lyuda she took Papa's hand, this was while the looters were stealing things,\n","but they didn't pay attention because they were stealing things. Apparently\n","they had already ceased killing and switched to stealing. Mamma found the\n","courage to . . .\n","\n","A boy said to my mother \"Where's the gold?\" Mamma said he must have been 12 \n","to 14 years old. He even looked Russian, he was so fair-skinned. But the \n","Azerbaijanis from Armenia are fair-skinned. I noticed they were all on the \n","fair side. He shouted, they were all smashing things, and he asks Mamma where \n","the gold is. We kept our gold in the wardrobe with our important papers. In a \n","little black bag, we kept everything in there. Mamma doesn't really like to \n","wear gold. She probably never even wore those things from the time they were \n","bought for her. They took everything that was lying on the cheval glass. Mamma\n","thinks that the gold saved us. Because they threw themselves at the gold, and \n","Mamma grabbed Papa, who was trying to breathe. They had closed his mouth, \n","bound his hands, and put a pillow and a chair on his face . . . They had \n","shoved something into his mouth so he would suffocate. Mamma grabbed him and \n","tore all that stuff off . . . He had something in his mouth, he was having \n","trouble breathing, his nose was filled with blood. Mamma grabbed him and \n","started running from the fifth down to the first floor because no one wanted \n","to open their doors to them. Mamma said that by accident, completely by \n","accident that person opened his door, he was sleeping, and said, half-awake, \n","\"What's happened?\" He sees that they are bloody. Mamma said, \"At least go and \n","find out what's happening to my daughters, even if they've burned them or \n","murdered them, at least bring the corpses.\" He went looking for us. At that \n","moment Lyuda was under the bed. She says that after they left it seemed that \n","someone was calling her name. When he quietly called her she couldn't get out \n","from under the bed. She wanted to get out and was calling softly. She thought \n","she was shouting, but in fact she was either silent or was only talking to \n","herself, it just seemed to her that she was shouting. When she got out from \n","under the bed everyone was gone. And again . . . She thought that she had lost\n","her mind. I'll never leave here, never! To hell with it! It just seems that \n","way to me, I'll come to eventually. But then, when everything had settled \n","down, stopped, that mall brought Lyuda down, and Igor carried me in from\n","outside. Or first I was brought in, then Lyuda, I don't remember what order it\n","happened in.\n","\n","And Mamma said, \"Listen, they're all running around down there, shouting \n","something or other, and running toward the other building.\" It had more or \n","less calmed down where we were. Who's dead, who's alive, we don't know. I \n","tried to call my girlfriend. I had basically come to. Mamma says, \"Listen;\n","let's go upstairs, at least get a mattress or something. We don't know how \n","long we'll be here. Maybe they didn't burn everything.\" I don't get it, all\n","women have that feeling, they want to get something from their homes, maybe \n","not everything was taken? I tell Mamma, \"Mamma, what do you need any of that \n","for? To hell with it! We're alive, forget the rest of it, all of it!\" She\n","says, \"No, let's go get at least something. Maybe we'll leave here, spend the \n","night at someone else's.\" Mamma went upstairs, and their little boy, their son\n","Alik, was standing on the lookout. lIe was standing there to see if they were \n","coming. They only managed to run up there and grab something one time. He \n","shouts, \"Come back, they're coming!\" They didn't have enough time to get a \n","lot, mattresses from one apartment, a blanket from another . . . Mamma got my \n","knitting . . . Someone managed to grab our old things, the ones we never wore,\n","out of the hall . . . Someone took Father's old coveralls. The neighbor, his \n","wife, Mamma and Papa . . . Marina went with them. I was in no condition to \n","leave. Neither was Lyuda. We just sat. They ran out and we closed the door and\n","just then we hear that the mob is on its way toward our place upstairs, \n","they're dragging something again. They were going toward the other building, \n","maybe over by the school, or . . . There was an unfinished building over\n","there, people said they were going toward the basement or the unfinished \n","building, they could gradually carry everything over there. Then things more \n","or less calmed down. I tried to call my boss.\n","\n","Later there was more noise. We were on the third floor, in a one-bedroom\n","apartment, and a woman lives in the one-bedroom place on the second floor,\n","Asya Dallakian. She's an old woman, retired. She wasn't at home, at that\n","time she was usually in the country, she has a married daughter there, and\n","her grandson is in the army. She is only very rarely in town; she gets her\n","retirement money and the apartment is essentially vacant. They started\n","pounding on her door and broke it down. She had two or three beds in there, \n","something like that, she's a 60-to 70-year-old woman who really does not even \n","live there. Probably she had some pots, a couple of metal bed frames and \n","mattresses, and a television. When her grandson came she bought a television. \n","They started wrecking everything. I started getting sick again. I think, \"My \n","God, what is going on around here? When will this end?\" We turned off the \n","lights and sat. As it turns out the people who weren't afraid, the ones who \n","knew what was going on, knew not to turn off the lights. We didn't know, but \n","they didn't come to where we were all the same. They all knew very well that \n","he was a captain. He went out and closed the door, and we sat in his \n","apartment. His last name was Kasumov. He's an exserviceman, retired, works up \n","at the fire station at some plant or other. He went out and stood at his door.\n","They tell him, \"Comrade Captain, don't worry, we won't harm you, you're one of\n","us.\" He went upstairs, and they say, \"Aren't you taking anything from this \n","apartment?\" He says, \"I don't need anything.\" And the women who were standing \n","in the yard . . . we have a basement, full of water . . . the women who were \n","standing in the yard saw. Those guys, they left everything they stole on the \n","first floor and ran upstairs again. The women threw everything they had time \n","to into the basement, to save our property. Some things were left: dirty \n","pillows, two or three other things and a rug. A guy came downstairs, really \n","mad, and he says, \"Where's the rug? I just put it right here!\" They tell him, \n","\"Some guy came and took it and went off toward the school.\" He ran off in that\n","direction.\n","\n","Oh! I forgot the most important point. When Igor picked me up in his arms, \n","there were women standing there who saw everything that was going on. They \n","just didn't tell me about it for a long time. The wife of that military man, \n","she didn't want to kill my spirit, I was already dead enough. Later she told \n","me, that after they murdered Uncle Shurik in the third entryway one of them, \n","the ringleader, apparently a young man, said, \"Where's the girl who was here?\"\n","And he became furious. The woman tells him, \"She came to . . . \" She didn't\n","know what to say: Think something up? Someone carried her off? Then they would\n","comb the whole house and find me and our whole family. So the woman says, \"She\n","came to and went to the basement.\" Now, our basement is full of water. So the \n","whole mob dashes off to the basement to look for me or my corpse. They took \n","flashlights; they were up to their waists in water, water which had been \n","standing there for years, and soot, and fuel oil. They climbed down in there \n","to get me. Then one of them said, \"There's so much water down there, she \n","probably walked and walked and then passed out and died. She met her death in \n","the basement. That's it, we can leave, no problem!\" I didn't know that, and \n","when I was told, I felt worse. Two times worse. A lot worse! So they didn't \n","just want to pound me flat, something more awful was awaiting me . . .\n","\n","After that we of course didn't want to live in Sumgait any longer. We really \n","didn't want to go back to our apartment. When we moved, I went up there and \n","started to quiver and shake all over, because I started remembering it all. \n","Although the neighbors all sobbed, it was all . . . so cheap . . . The people \n","who sat in their apartments and didn't help us at a time like that. I think \n","that they could have helped! I don't think that they were obligated to, but \n","they could have helped us! Because that one woman was able to stop that whole \n","brutal crowd by herself. That means they could have, too. It would have been\n","enough foe one man or women to say, What do you think you're doing?\" That's \n","all! That would have done it. There were 60 apartments in our building. Not \n","one person said it! When I was lying on the ground and all those people were \n","standing on their balconies I didn't hear anyone's voice, no one said what are\n","you doing, leave her alone . . . Mamma even told one of the neighbor women \n","that if it had been an Azerbaijani woman in my place they would have dropped a\n","bomb if it would have killed even one Armenian. They would have stood up for \n","one of their own. True, they say that our neighbor from the fourth entryway, \n","an old/ sick woman tried to stop the pogrom. The Azerbaijanis have a custom: \n","if a woman takes her scarf and throws it on the ground, the men are supposed \n","to stop immediately. The old woman from the fourth entryway did that, but they\n","stomped her scarf into the ground, pushed her off to the side, and said, \"If\n","you want to go on living, you'll disappear into your apartment.\" So she left.\n","That trick didn't work on them.\n","\n","Even the neighbors who helped us move told me, OK, fine, calm down, forget \n","that it happened. I said I'd only forget it if I told them right then that it\n","had happened to their daughter--and if that didn't have any effect on them, \n","then I would forget everything, too. Imagine that it happened to your sister. \n","And no one did anything. Anything.\n","\n","   April 25, 1988\n","   Yerevan\n","\n","\t\t\t- - - reference - - -\n","\n","[1] _The Sumgait Tragedy; Pogroms against Armenians in Soviet Azerbaijan,\n","    Volume I, Eyewitness Accounts_, edited by Samuel Shahmuradian, forward by\n","    Yelena Bonner, 1990, published by Aristide D.

We paid for it in human casualties and crippled fates--the\n","price was too great! Now, after the Sumgait tragedy, we, the victims, divide\n","our lives into \"before\" and ''after.\" We talk like that: that was before the\n","war. Like the people who went through World War II and considered it a whole\n","epoch, a fate. No matter how many years go by, no matter how long we live,\n","it will never be forgotten. On the contrary, some of the moments become even \n","sharper: in our rage, in our sorrow, we saw everything differently, but now\n",". . . They say that you can see more with distance, and we can see those\n","inhuman events with more clarity now . . . we more acutely perceive our\n","losses and everything that happened.\n","\n","Nineteen eighty-eight was a leap year. Everyone fears a leap year and wants it\n","to pass as quickly as possible. Yet we never thought that that leap year would\n","be such a black one for every Sumgait Armenian: those who lost someone and \n","those who didn't.\n","\n","That second to last day of winter was ordinary for our family, although you \n","could already smell danger in the air. But we didn't think that the danger was\n","near and possible, so we didn't take any steps to save ourselves. At least, as\n","my parents say, at least we should have done something to save the children. \n","My parents themselves are not that old, 52 and 53 years. But then they thought\n","that they had already lived enough, and did everything they could to save us.\n","\n","In our apartment the tragedy started on February 28, around five in the\n","afternoon. I call it a tragedy, and I repeat: it was a tragedy even though all\n","our family survived. When I recall how they broke down our door my skin\n","crawls; even now, among Armenians, among people who wish me only well, I feel\n","like it's all starting over again. I remember how that mob broke into our \n","apartment . . . My parents were standing in the hall. My father had an axe in \n","his hands and had immediately locked both of the doors. Our door was rarely \n","locked since friends and neighbors often dropped by. We're known as a \n","hospitable family, and we just never really thought about whether the people \n","who were coming to see us were Azerbaijanis, Jews, or Russians. We had friends\n","of many nationalities, even a Turkmen woman.\n","\n","My parents were in the hall, my father with an axe. I remember him telling my \n","mother, \"Run to the kitchen for a knife.\" But Mother was detached, pale, as \n","though she had decided to sell her life a bit dearer. To be honest I never \n","expected it of her, she's afraid of getting shot and afraid of the dark. A \n","girlfriend was at the house that day, a Russian girl, Lyuda, and Mamma said, \n","\"No matter what happens, no matter what they do to us, you're not to come out \n","of the bedroom. We're going to tell them that we're alone in the apartment.\"\n","\n","We went into the bedroom. There were four of us. Marina and the Russian girl \n","crawled under the bed, and we covered them up with a rug, boxes of dishes, and\n","Karina and I are standing there and looking at one another. The idea that \n","perhaps we were seeing each other for the last time flashed somewhere inside \n","me. I'm an emotional person and I express my emotions immediately. I wanted to\n","embrace her and kiss her, as though it were the last second. And maybe Karina \n","was thinking the same thing, but she's quite reserved. We didn't have time to \n","say anything to each other because we immediately heard Mamma raise a shout. \n","There was so much noise from the tramping of feet, from the shouting, and from\n","excited voices. I couldn't figure what was going on out there because the door\n","to the bedroom was only open a crack. But when Mamma shouted the second time\n","Karina ran out of the bedroom. I ran after her, I had wanted to hold her back,\n","but when she opened the door and ran out into the hall they saw us \n","immediately. The only thing I managed to do was close the door behind me, at \n","least so as to save Marina and her friend. The mob was shouting, all of their \n","eyes were shining, all red, like from insomnia. At first about 40 people burst\n","in, but later I was standing with my back to the door and couldn't see. They \n","came into the hall, into the kitchen, and dragged my father into the other \n","room. He didn't utter a word, he just raised the axe to hit them, but Mamma \n","snatched the axe from behind and said, \"Tell them not to touch the children. \n","Tell them they can do as they want with us, but not to harm the children.\" She\n","said this to Father in Armenian.\n","\n","There were Azerbaijanis from Armenia among the mob who broke in. They \n","understood Armenian perfectly. The local Azerbaijanis don't know Armenian, \n","they don't need to speak it. And one of them responded in Armenian: \"You and \n","your children both . . . we're going to do the same thing to you and your \n","children that you Armenians did in Kafan. They killed our women, our girls, \n","our mothers, they cut their breasts off, and burned our houses . . . ,\" and \n","so on and so forth, \"and we came to do the same thing to you.\" This whole time\n","some of them are destroying the house and the others are shouting at us. They \n","were mostly young people, under 30. At first there weren't any older people \n","among them. And all of their faces were unfamiliar. Sumgait is a small town, \n","all the same, and we know a lot of people by their faces, especially me, I'm \n","a teacher.\n","\n","So they dragged my father into the other room. They twisted his arms and took \n","him in there, no they didn't take him in there, they dragged him in there,\n","because he was already unable to walk. They closed the door to that room all \n","but a crack. We couldn't see what was happening to Father, what they were \n","doing to him. Then a young man, about 26 years old, started to tear off \n","Mamma's sarafan, and Mamma shouted at him in Azerbaijani: \"I'm old enough to \n","be your mother! What are you doing?!\" He struck her. Now he's being held, \n","Mamma identified him. I hope he's convicted. Then they went after Karina, \n","who's been talking to them like a Komsomol leader, as though she were trying \n","to lead them down a different path, as they say, to influence their \n","consciousness. She told them that what they were doing was wrong, that they \n","mustn't do it. She said, \"Come on, let's straighten this out, without \n","emotions. What do you want? Who are you? Why did you come here? What did we \n","ever do to you?\" Someone tried to explain who they were and why they had come \n","into our home, but then the ones in the back--more of them kept coming and \n","coming--said, \"What are you talking to, them for. You should kill them. We \n","came here to kill them.\"\n","\n","They pushed Karina, struck her, and she fell down. They beat her, but she \n","didn't cry out. Even when they tore her clothes off, she kept repeating, \"What\n","did we do to you? What did we do to you?\" And even later, when she came to, \n","she said, \"Mamma, what did we do to them? Why did they do that to us?\"\n","\n","That group was prepared, I know this because I noticed that some of them only \n","broke up furniture, and others only dealt with us. I remember that when they \n","were beating me, when they were tearing my clothes off, I felt neither pain \n","nor shame because my entire attention was riveted to Karina. All I could do \n","was watch how much they beat her and how painful it was for her, and what they\n","did to her. That's why I felt no pain. Later, when they carried Karina off, \n","they beat her savagely . . . It's really amazing that she not only lived, but \n","didn't lose her mind . She is very beautiful and they did everything they \n","could to destroy her beauty. Mostly they beat her face, with their fists, \n","kicking her, using anything they could find.\n","\n","Mamma, Karina, and I were all in one room. And again I didn't feel any pain, \n","just didn't feel any, no matter how much they beat me, no matter what they \n","did. Then one of those creeps said that there wasn't enough room in the\n","apartment. They broke up the beds and the desk and moved everything into the \n","corners so there would be more room. Then someone suggested, \"Let's take her \n","outside.\"\n","\n","Those beasts were in Heaven. They did what they would do every day if they \n","weren't afraid of the authorities. Those were their true colors. At the time \n","I thought that in fact they would always behave that way if they weren't \n","afraid of what would happen to them.\n","\n","When they carried Karina out and beat Mamma-her face was completely covered \n","with blood--that's when I started to feel the pain. I blacked out several \n","times from the pain, but each moment that I had my eyes open it was as though \n","I were recording it all on film. I think I'm a kind person by nature, but I'm \n","vengeful, especially if someone is mean to me, and I don't deserve it. I hold \n","a grudge a long time if someone intentionally causes me pain. And every time \n","I would come to and see one of those animals on top of me, I'd remember them, \n","and I'll remember them for the rest of my life, even though people tell me \n","\"forget,\" you have to forget, you have to go on living.\n","\n","At some point I remember that they stood me up and told me something, and \n","despite the fact that I hurt all over--I had been beaten terribly--I found\n","the strength in myself to interfere with their tortures. I realized that I had\n","to do something: resist them or just let them kill me to bring my suffering \n","to an end. I pushed one of them away, he was a real horse. I remember now that\n","he's being held, too. As though they were all waiting for it, they seized me\n","and took me out onto the balcony. I had long hair, and it was stuck all over\n","me. One of the veranda shutters to the balcony was open, and I realized that\n","they planned to throw me out the window, because they had already picked me up\n","with their hands, I was up in the air. As though for the last time I took a \n","really deep breath and closed my eyes, and somehow braced myself inside, I \n","suddenly became cold, as though my heart had sunk into my feet. And suddenly \n","I felt myself flying. I couldn't figure out if I was really flying or if I \n","just imagined it. When I came to I thought now I'm going to smash on the \n","ground. And when it didn't happen I opened my eyes and realized that I was \n","still lying on the floor. And since I didn't scream, didn't beg them at all,\n","they became all the more wild, like wolves. They started to trample me with\n","their feet. Shoes with heels on them, and iron horseshoes, like they had spe-\n","cially put them on. Then I lost consciousness.\n","\n","I came to a couple of times and waited for death, summoned it, beseeched it. \n","Some people ask for good health, life, happiness, but at that moment I didn't \n","need any of those things. I was sure that none of us would survive, and I had \n","even forgotten about Marina; and if none of us was alive, it wasn't worth \n","living.\n","\n","There was a moment when the pain was especially great. I withstood inhuman \n","pain, and realized that they were going to torment me for a long time to come \n","because I had showed myself to be so tenacious. I started to strangle myself, \n","and when I started to wheeze they realized that with my death I was going to\n","put an end to their pleasures, and they pulled my hands from my throat. The \n","person who injured and insulted me most painfully I remember him very well, \n","because he was the oldest in the group. He looked around 48. I know that he \n","has four children and that he considers himself an ideal father and person, \n","one who would never do such a thing. Something came over him then, you see, \n","even during the investigation he almost called me \"daughter,\" he apologized, \n","although, of course, he knew that I'd never forgive him. Something like that \n","I can never forgive. I have never injured anyone with my behavior, with my \n","words, or with my deeds, I have always put myself in the other person's shoes,\n","but then, in a matter of hours, they trampled me entirely. I shall never \n","forget it.\n","\n","I wanted to do myself in then, because I had nothing to lose, because no one \n","could protect me. My father, who tried to do something against that hoard of \n","beasts by himself, could do nothing and wouldn't be able to do anything.\n","I knew that I was even sure that he was no longer alive.\n","\n","And Ira Melkumian, my acquaintance I knew her and had been to see her family a\n","couple of times--her brother tried to save her and couldn't, so he tried to \n","kill her, his very own sister. He threw an axe at her to kill her and put an \n","end to her suffering. When they stripped her clothes off and carried her into \n","the other room, her brother knew what awaited her. I don't know which one it \n","was, Edik or Igor. Both of them were in the room from which the axe was \n","thrown. But the axe hit one of the people carrying her and so they killed her \n","and made her death even more excruciating, maybe the most excruciating of all \n","the deaths of those days in Sumgait. I heard about it all from the neighbor \n","from the Melkumians' landing. His name is Makhaddin, he knows my family a \n","little. He came to see how we had gotten settled in the new apartment in Baku,\n","how we were feeling, and if we needed anything. He's a good person. He said, \n","\"You should praise God that you all survived. But what I saw with my own eyes,\n","I, a man, who has seen so many people die, who has lived a whole life, I,\" he\n","says, \"nearly lost my mind that day. I had never seen the likes of it and \n","think I never shall again.\" The door to his apartment was open and he saw \n","everything. One of the brothers threw the axe, because they had already taken \n","the father and mother out of the apartment. Igor, Edik, and Ira remained. He \n","saw Ira, naked, being carried into the other room in the hands of six or seven\n","people. He told us about it and said he would never forget it. He heard the \n","brothers shouting something, inarticulate from pain, rage, and the fact that \n","they were powerless to do anything. But all the same they tried to \n","do something. The guy who got hit with the axe lived.                                                                           I     I\n","\n","After I had been unsuccessful at killing myself I saw them taking Marina and \n","Lyuda out of the bedroom. I was in such a state that I couldn't even \n","remember my sister's name. I wanted to cry \"Marina!\" out to her, but could\n","not. I looked at her and knew that it was a familiar, dear face, but couldn't\n","for the life of me remember what her name was and who she was. And thus\n","I saved her, because when they were taking her out, she, as it turns out, had\n","told them that she had just been visiting and that she and Lyuda were both\n","there by chance, that they weren't Armenians. Lyuda's a Russian, you can tell \n","right away, and Marina speaks Azerbaijani wonderfully and she told them that\n","she was an Azerbaijani. And I almost gave her away and doomed her. I'm glad \n","that at least Marina came out of this all in good physical health . . . \n","although her spirit was murdered . . .\n","\n","At some point I came to and saw Igor, Igor Agayev, my acquaintance, in that \n","mob. He lives in the neighboring building. For some reason I remembered his \n","name, maybe I sensed my defense in him. I called out to him in Russian, \"Igor,\n","help!\" But he turned away and went into the bedroom. Just then they were \n","taking Marina and Lyuda out of the bedroom. Igor said he knew Marina and \n","Lyuda, that Marina in fact was Azerbaijani, and he took both of them to the \n","neighbors.\n","\n","And the idea stole through me that maybe Igor had led them to our apartment, \n","something like that, but if he was my friend, he was supposed to save me.\n"," \n","Then they were striking me very hard--we have an Indian vase, a metal one, \n","they were hitting me on the back with it and I blacked out--they took me out \n","onto the balcony a second time to throw me out the window. They were already \n","sure that I was dead because I didn't react at all to the new blows. Someone \n","said, \"She's already dead, let's throw her out.\" When they carried me out onto\n","the balcony for the second time, when I was about to die the second time, I \n","heard someone say in Azerbaijani: \"Don't kill her, I know her, she's a \n","teacher.\" I can still hear that voice ringing in my ears, but I can't remember\n","whose voice it was. It wasn't Igor, because he speaks Azerbaijani with an \n","accent: his mother is Russian and they speak Russian at home. He speaks\n","Azerbaijani worse than our Marina does. I remember when they carried me in and\n","threw me on the bed he came up to me, that person, and \tI having opened my \n","eyes, saw and recognized that person, but immediately passed out cold. I had \n","been beaten so much that I didn't have the strength to remember him. I only \n","remember that this person was older and he had a high position. Unfortunately \n","I can't remember anything more.\n","\n","What should I say about Igor? He didn't treat me badly. I had heard a lot \n","about him, that he wasn't that good a person, that he sometimes drank too\n","much. Once he boasted to me that he had served in Afghanistan. He knew that \n","women usually like bravery in a man. Especially if a man was in Afghanistan,\n","if he was wounded, then it's about eighty percent sure that he will be treated\n","very sympathetically, with respect. Later I found out that he had served in \n","Ufa, and was injured, but that's not in Afghanistan, of course. I found that \n","all out later.\n","\n","Among the people who were in our apartment, my Karina also saw the Secretary \n","of the Party organization. I don't know his last name, his first name is \n","Najaf, he is an Armenian-born Azerbaijani. But later Karina wasn't so sure,\n","she was no longer a hundred percent sure that it was he she saw, and she \n","didn't want to endanger him. She said, \"He was there,\" and a little while \n","later, \"Maybe they beat me so much that I am confusing him with someone else. \n","No, it seems like it was he.\" I am sure it was he because when he came to see \n","us the first time he said one thing, and the next time he said something \n","entirely different. The investigators haven't summoned him yet. He came to see\n","us in the Khimik boarding house where we were living at the time. He brought \n","groceries and flowers, this was right before March 8th; he almost started \n","crying, he was so upset to see our condition. I don't know if he was putting \n","us on or not, but later, after we had told the investigator and they summoned \n","him to the Procuracy, he said that he had been in Baku, he wasn't in Sumgait. \n","The fact that he changed his testimony leads me to believe that Karina is \n","right, that in fact it was he who was in our apartment. I don't know how the \n","investigators are now treating him. At one point I wondered and asked, and was\n","told that he had an alibi and was not in our apartment. Couldn't he have gone \n","to Baku and arranged an alibi? I'm not ruling out that possibility.\n","\n","Ill now return to our apartment. Mamma had come to. You could say that she \n","bought them off with the gold Father gave her when they were married: her \n","wedding band and her watch were gold. She bought her own and her husband's \n","lives with them. She gave the gold to a 14-year old boy. Vadim Vorobyev. A \n","Russian boy, he speaks Azerbaijani perfectly. He's an orphan who was raised by\n","his grandfather and who lives in Sumgait on Nizami Street. He goes to a \n","special school, one for mentally handicapped children. But I'll say this--I'm \n","a teacher all the same and in a matter of minutes I can form an opinion--that\n","boy is not at all mentally handicapped. He's healthy, he can think just fine, \n","and analyze, too . . . policemen should be so lucky. And he's cunning, too. \n","After that he went home and tore all of the pictures out of his photo album.\n","\n","He beat Mamma and demanded gold, saying, \"Lady, if you give us all the gold \n","and money in your apartment we'll let you live.\" And Mamma told them where \n","the gold was. He brought in the bag and opened it, shook out the contents, and \n","everyone who was in the apartment jumped on it, started knocking each other \n","over and taking the gold from one another. I'm surprised they didn't kill one \n","another right then.\n","\n","Mamma was still in control of herself. She had been beaten up, her face was\n","black and blue from the blows, and her eyes were filled with blood, and she \n","ran into the other room. Father was lying there, tied up, with a gag in his\n","mouth and a pillow over his face. There was a broken table on top of the pil-\n","low. Mamma grabbed Father and he couldn't walk; like me, he was half dead, \n","halfway into the other world. He couldn't comprehend anything, couldn't see, \n","and was covered with black and blue. Mamma pulled the gag out of his mouth, \n","it was some sort of cloth, I think it was a slipcover from an armchair.\n","\n","The bandits were still in our apartment, even in the room Mamma pulled Father \n","out of, led him out of, carried him out of. We had two armchairs in that room,\n","a small magazine table, a couch, a television, and a screen. Three people \n","were standing next to that screen, and into their shirts, their pants, \n","everywhere imaginable, they were shoving shot glasses and cups from the coffee\n","service--Mamma saw them out of the corner of her eye. She said, \"I was afraid \n","to turn around, I just seized Father and started pulling him, but at the \n","threshold I couldn't hold him up, he fell down, and I picked him up again and \n","dragged him down the stairs to the neighbors'.\" Mamma remembered one of the \n","criminals, the one who had watched her with his face half-turned toward her, \n","out of one eye. She says, \"I realized that my death would come from that \n","person. I looked him in the eyes and he recoiled from fear and went stealing.\"\n","Later they caught that scoundrel. Meanwhile, Mamma grabbed Father and left.\n","\n","I was alone. Igor had taken Marina away, Mamma and Father were gone, Karina \n","was already outside, I didn't know what they were doing to her. I was left all\n","alone, and at that moment . . . I became someone else, do you understand? Even\n","though I knew that neither Mother and Father in the other room, nor Marina and\n","Lyuda under the bed could save me, all the same I somehow managed to hold out.\n","I went on fighting them, I bit someone, I remember, and I scratched another. \n","But when I was left alone I realized what kind of people they were, the ones \n","I had observed, the ones who beat Karina, what kind of people they were, the \n","ones who beat me, that it was all unnecessary, that I was about to die and \n","that all of that would die with me.\n","\n","At some point I took heart when I saw the young man from the next building. I \n","didn't know his name, but we would greet one another when we met, we knew that\n","we were from the same microdistrict. When I saw him I said, \"Neighbor, is that\n","you?\" In so doing I placed myself in great danger. He realized that if I lived\n","I would remember him. That's when he grabbed the axe. The axe that had been \n","taken from my father. I automatically fell to my knees and raised my hands to \n","take the blow of the axe, although at the time it would have been better if he\n","had struck me in the head with the axe and put me out of my misery. When he \n","started getting ready to wind back for the blow, someone came into the room. \n","The newcomer had such an impact on everyone that my neighbor's axe froze in \n","the air. Everyone stood at attention for this guy, like soldiers in the \n","presence of a general. Everyone waited for his word: continue the atrocities \n","or not. He said, \"Enough, let's go to the third entryway.\" In the third \n","entryway they killed Uncle Shurik, Aleksandr Gambarian. This confirms once \n","again that they had prepared in advance. Almost all of them left with him, as \n","they went picking up pillows, blankets, whatever they needed, whatever they \n","found, all the way up to worn out slippers and one boot, someone else had \n","already taken the other.\n","\n","Four people remained in the room, soldiers who didn't obey their general. They\n","had to have come recently, because other faces had flashed in front of me over\n","those 2 to 3 hours, but I had never seen those three. One of them, Kuliyev (I \n","identified him later), a native of the Sisian District of Armenia, an \n","Azerbaijani, had moved to Azerbaijan a year before. He told me in Armenian:\n","\"Sister, don't be afraid, I'll drive those three Azerbaijanis out of here.\"\n","That's just what he said, \"those Azerbaijanis,\" as though he himself were not \n","Azerbaijani, but some other nationality, he said with such hatred, \"I'll drive\n","them out of here now, and you put your clothes on, and find a hammer and nails\n","and nail the door shut, because they'll be coming back from Apartment 41.\" \n","That's when I found out that they had gone to Apartment 41. Before that, the \n","person in the Eskimo dogskin coat, the one who came in and whom they listened \n","to, the \"general,\" said that they were going to the third entryway.\n","\n","Kuliyev helped me get some clothes on, because l couldn't do it by myself. \n","Marina's old fur coat was lying on the floor. He threw it over my shoulders, I\n","was racked with shivers, and he asked where he could find nails and a hammer. \n","He wanted to give them to me so that when he left I could nail the door shut. \n","But the door was lying on the floor in the hall.\n","\n","I went out onto the balcony. There were broken windows, and flowers and dirt \n","from flowerpots were scattered on the floor. It was impossible to find \n","anything. He told me, \"Well, fine, I won't leave you here. Would any of the \n","neighbors let you in? They'll be back, they won't calm down, they know you're \n","alive.\" He told me all this in Armenian.\n","\n","Then he returned to the others and said, \"What are you waiting for? Leave!\" \n","They said, \"Ah, you just want to chase us out of here and do it with her \n","yourself. No, we want to do it to.\" He urged them on, but gently, not \n","coarsely, because he was alone against them, although they were still just\n","boys, not old enough to be drafted. He led them out of the room, and went\n","down to the third floor with them himself, and said, \"Leave. What's the mat-\n","ter, aren't you men? Go fight with the men. What do you want of her?\" And\n","he came back upstairs. They wanted to come up after him and he realized that \n","he couldn't hold them off forever. Then he asked me where he could hide me. I \n","told him at the neighbors' on the fourth floor, Apartment 10, we were on really\n","good terms with them.\n","\n","We knocked on the door, and he explained in Azerbaijani. The neighbor woman \n","opened the door and immediately said, \"I'm an Azerbaijani.\" He said, \"I know. \n","Let her sit at your place a while. Don't open the door to anyone, no one knows\n","about this, I won't tell anyone. Let her stay at your place.\" She says, \"Fine,\n","have her come in.\" I went in. She cried a bit and gave me some stockings, I \n","had gone entirely numb and was racked with nervous shudders. I burst into \n","tears. Even though I was wearing Marina's old fur coat, it's a short one, a \n","half-length, I was cold all the same. I asked, \"Do you know where my family \n","is, what happened to them?\" She says, \"No, I don't know anything. I'm afraid \n","to go out of the apartment, now they're so wild that they don't look to see \n","who's Azerbaijani and who's Armenian.\" Kuliyev left. Ten minutes later my \n","neighbor says, \"You know, Lyuda, I don't want to lose my life because of you, \n","or my son and his wife. Go stay with someone else.\" During the butchery in our\n","apartment one of the scum, a sadist, took my earring in his mouth--I had pearl\n","earrings on--and ripped it out, tearing the earlobe. The other earring was \n","still there. When I'm nervous I fix my hair constantly, and then, when I \n","touched my ear, I noticed that I had one earring on. I took it out and gave it\n","to her. She took the earring, but she led me out of the apartment.\n","\n","I went out and didn't know where to go. I heard someone going upstairs. I \n","don't know who it was but assumed it was them. With tremendous difficulty I \n","end up to our apartment, I wanted to die in my own home. I go into the \n","apartment and hear that they are coming up to our place, to the fifth floor. \n","I had to do something. I went into the bedroom where Marina and Lyuda had \n","hidden and saw that the bed was overturned. Instead of hiding I squatted near \n","some broken Christmas ornaments, found an unbroken one, and started sobbing. \n","Then they came in. Someone said that there were still some things to take. I \n","think that someone pushed me under the bed. I lay on the floor, and there were\n","broken ornaments on it, under my head and legs. I got all cut up, but I lay \n","there without moving. My heart was beating so hard it seemed the whole town \n","could hear it. There were no lights on. Maybe that's what saved me. They were \n","burning matches, and toward the end they brought in a candle. They started\n","picking out the clothes that could still be worn. They took Father's sport \n","jacket and a bedspread, the end of which was under my head. They pulled on the\n","one end, and it felt like they were pulling my hair out. I almost cried out. \n","And again I realized I wasn't getting out of there alive, and I started to \n","strangle myself again. I took my throat in one hand, and pressed the other on \n","my mouth, so as not to wheeze, so that I would die and they would only find me\n","afterward. They were throwing the burned matches under the bed, and I got \n","burned, but I withstood it. Something inside of me held on, someone's hand was\n","protecting me to the end. I knew that I was going to die, but I didn't know \n","how. I knew that if I survived I would walk out of that apartment, but if \n","I found out that one of my family had died, I would die for sure, because I \n","had never been so close to death and couldn't imagine how you could go on \n","living without your mother or father, or without your sister. Marina, I \n","thought, was still alive: she went to Lyuda's place or someone is hiding her. \n","I tried to think that Igor wouldn't let them be killed. He served in \n","Afghanistan, he should protect her.\n","\n","While I was strangling myself I said my good-byes to everyone. And then I\n","thought, how could Marina survive alone. If they killed all of us, how would \n","she live all by herself? There were six people in the room. They talked among \n","themselves and smoked. One talked about his daughter, saying that there was no\n","children's footwear in our apartment that he could take for his daughter. \n","Another said that he liked the apartment--recently we had done a really good \n","job fixing everything up--and that he would live there after everything was \n","all over. They started to argue. A third one says, \"How come you get it? I \n","have four children, and there are three rooms here, that's just what I need. \n","All these years I've been living in God-awful places.\" Another one says, \n","\"Neither of you gets it. We'll set fire to it and leave.\" Then someone said \n","that Azerbaijanis live right next door, the fire could move over to their\n","place. And they, to my good fortune, didn't set fire to the apartment, and\n","left.\n","\n","Oh, yes, I just remembered. While they were raping me they repeated quite \n","frequently, \"Let the Armenian women have babies for us, Muslim babies, let \n","them bear Azerbaijanis for the struggle against the Armenians.\" Then they \n","said, \"Those Muslims can carry on our holy cause. Heroes!\" They repeated it \n","very often.\n","\n","\t\t     - - - reference for #008 - - -\n","\n","[1] _The Sumgait Tragedy; Pogroms against Armenians in Soviet Azerbaijan,\n","    Volume I, Eyewitness Accounts_, edited by Samuel Shahmuradian, forward by\n","    Yelena Bonner, 1990, published by Aristide D.

EDT\n","\t     \n","\t     \n","\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Good evening and welcome to all of you \n","in the thousands of communities around the country that are taking \n","part in this satellite town meeting for the month of April.\n","\t     \n","\t     You know, today is April 13th.  In 1743, Thomas \n","Jefferson was born, 250 years ago.  I think that's appropriate to \n","mention at the beginning of this meeting because since that time he \n","has been, of course, a person who has been one that we've all \n","followed in terms of our democracy and the importance of education \n","here in this great country.  The success of our democracy according \n","to Jefferson really depends upon the success of our educational \n","system.\n","\t     \n","\t     His philosophy of government, his belief in the \n","importance of education is also very meaningful to our special guest \n","here this evening.  Tonight we're so pleased to have with us \n","President Clinton.  He's come over from the White House to join us in \n","the Chamber of Commerce studios.  \n","\t     \n","\t     Mr. President, it's good to have you.  We thank you for \n","taking the time to visit with these communities here on the satellite \n","network and we welcome you here this evening.\n","\t     \n","\t     Also we have with us Secretary of Labor Robert Reich.  \n","And, Bob, it's certainly pleasant to have you with us this evening \n","also.\n","\t     \n","\t     I have some questions for our two guests, and I'm sure \n","many of you do, too.  So please call us if there's something that \n","you'd like to ask.  The number is 1/800/368-5781 or 5782.  In \n","Washington, D.C. the number is 202/463-3170 or 3171.\n","\t     \n","\t     I believe the President has a few words that he might \n","want to share with us.  And, Mr. President, I'll ask you to do that \n","at this time.  It's great to have you.\n","\t     \n","\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary.\n","\t     \n","\t     I'm glad to be here with my friends, Dick Riley and Bob \n","Reich -- also members of my Cabinet -- at the headquarters of the \n","Chamber of Commerce to support the effort that the Chamber is making, \n","along with its Center for Work Force Preparation, to help to examine \n","tonight the whole critical question of how to move our young people \n","from school to the work place.\n","\t     \n","\t     I want to compliment the Chamber on all their efforts, \n","recognizing that without an educated work force we can't grow this \n","economy or remain competitive, and recognizing that we all have to \n","work together -- business and government, labor and educators -- to \n","make things happen.\n","\t     \n","\t     This satellite town meeting is a good example of that \n","kind of working together.  And if you'll forgive me a little home \n","state pride, I want to say a special word of thanks to the Wal-Mart \n","Corporation, headquartered in Bentonville, Arkansas, for providing \n","several hundred of the sites for this town meeting tonight.  I \n","appreciate that a lot, as well as the sites that are provided for all \n","the rest of you.\n","\t     \n","\t     I have tried as hard as I could to move toward \n","constructive change for this country.  Secretary Riley talked about \n","this being Thomas Jefferson's 250th birthday.  If Thomas Jefferson \n","believed in anything, he believed in these three things:  first, in \n","education; second, in real personal liberty, freedom of religion, \n","freedom of speech, freedom of association, freedom of the press; and \n","third, in the absolute imperative of changing as times change.  \n","\t     \n","\t     If you go to the Jefferson Memorial here in this \n","beautiful city, which is now bedecked with all of its wonderful \n","cherry blossoms, you will see Jefferson saying that we have to change \n","with changing times.\n","\t     \n","\t     For us here in America, that means reducing our deficit \n","and increasing our investment and putting our people first so that we \n","can compete in the world.  We're here to talk about that tonight --\n","about what we can do to educate and train our people better.  Unless \n","we do that, none of the efforts that all the rest of us make in \n","government, even to bring the budget into balance, even to increase \n","our investment in other things which will grow jobs, will last in the \n","long run.\n","\t     \n","\t     We also have to have people who can carry their load.  \n","And in a world where the average young person will change jobs seven \n","or eight times in a lifetime, that begins with the education system \n","and continues into the work force where education must go on for a \n","lifetime.  It's not just important what you know, but what you can \n","learn.\n","\t     \n","\t     And if I might, I'd like to close just by emphasizing \n","we're doing our best to try to have the most innovative partnership \n","between the Labor Department and the Education Department and the \n","private sector to build a good school-to-work transition.  And we're \n","trying to get off to a good start this summer with a program that \n","would create more than 700,000 new summer jobs, including many \n","thousands that have a strong education component so our young people \n","can be learning and working at the same time.\n","\t     \n","\t     Dick, I think I ought to stop there.  That's a good \n","place we can begin, I think, the discussion.\n","\t     \n","\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you so much, Mr. President.\n","\t     \n","\t     Each month we get together and talk about ways that all \n","citizens can work towards reaching the national education goals.  And \n","tonight, we'll focus on goal five, and how communities such as yours \n","can prepare students for this world of work.\n","\t     \n","\t     This week, the Education Department and the Labor \n","Department are hosting a conference here in Washington, D.C. called \n","Summer Challenge, a program of work and learning, to America's youth.  \n","The aim is to use some special funds from President Clinton's \n","proposed economic stimulus package to provide educationally-enriched \n","jobs and summer school programs for young people in disadvantaged \n","areas of the country.  \n","\t     \n","\t     Mr. President, let's talk a minute -- you alluded to it \n","somewhat -- about the  Summer Youth Challenge.  Your program calls \n","for more educational enrichment in the summer jobs.  And why in your \n","words is that so important?\n","\t     \n","\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I think it's important for two reasons.  \n","First of all, a lot of the young people we're trying to reach may \n","have had trouble adjusting to school and learning.  And while we want \n","them to have a good experience with a real job, we also want them to \n","continue to learn during the summer because we know from a lot of \n","research that a lot of kids that have trouble learning in school may \n","forget as much as 30 percent of what they learned the previous year \n","over the summertime.  And that is a very unproductive thing for \n","schools to have to take up a lot of time teaching what they already \n","taught before.\n","\t     \n","\t     Secondly, we want to help these young people progress, \n","not only in terms of work, but in terms of learning.  We want to \n","abolish the artificial dividing line between what is work and what is \n","learning because we think that the best and most productive workers \n","will have to be lifetime learners.  And we think that this experience \n","could maybe drive that point home and prepare these young people to \n","succeed in school, or at work, or in college as they go on.\n","\t     \n","\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, I think the fact that these are \n","disadvantaged kids -- that gap, that lag you mentioned as they go \n","into the next year, is really even greater.  \n","\t     \n","\t     Secretary Reich, of course, you have training programs \n","throughout the year.  And I wonder is you have any comment about this \n","educational component of training.\n","\t     \n","\t     SECRETARY REICH:  Well, what we've learned, Mr. \n","Secretary, is that for many young people, whether it's for the summer \n","or for the year, actually on-the-job work experience combined with \n","education is one of the best ways of learning.  Many young people, \n","for example, have a lot -- they have a difficult time learning \n","geometry.  But when they actually are there building something or \n","working on something, and they can see the exact and direct \n","application of geometry, they understand what it's used for.  And a \n","lot of young people -- just that sense of connection between \n","education and the world of work is terribly, terribly important.  \n","It's important during the summer, but it's important for a lot of \n","young people even beyond the summer.\n","\t     \n","\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you.  \n","\t     \n","\t     Mr. President, you've called for a youth apprenticeship \n","program, school-to-work transition.  And I wonder if you would tell \n","us a little bit about your concept of that and how you see it \n","developing.\n","\t     \n","\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, first of all, let's talk about why \n","it's important.  Most new jobs that will be created in this decade \n","will not require a four-year college degree, but most of them will \n","require some learning and skills that go well beyond what most people \n","get in a high school diploma.  \n","\t     \n","\t     If you look at the last 10 years, the average salaries \n","of young people that had at least two years of good post-high school \n","education was a good salary that went up over the decade.  The young \n","people who had less than that tended to have lower wages that did not \n","go up, and in many cases in real terms fell over the decade, because \n","they weren't productive, they weren't more valuable to their \n","employers.\n","\t     \n","\t     So we think America has a big economic interest in \n","trying to ensure that all the young people who get out of high school \n","but don't go on to college make a transition to work, which includes \n","two years of further training either in a community college, a \n","vocational setting, or perhaps on the job.  And what I have done in \n","this budget, as you know, is to give you and Secretary Reich some \n","funds and some incentives to try to work in partnership with states \n","and with the private sector to build these programs state-by-state in \n","a way that would be customized essentially by the business community, \n","based on the needs of the economy in any given area.  It could \n","revolutionize long-term the quality of the American work force and \n","the earnings of American workers.\n","\t     \n","\t     SECRETARY REICH:  I should add, Mr. President -- I think \n","you know this from your experience in Arkansas -- and many of the \n","people watching this program -- that the business community and \n","educators, labor groups are already in many of our communities, many \n","of our states, building a school-to-work transition program.  In \n","fact, there's an awful lot of ferment, a lot of excitement.  The \n","people watching this program probably are the ones who are most \n","directly involved in that.  And more power to them.  Secretary Riley \n","and I are going to do everything we can to build on the successes \n","already out there.\n","\t     \n","\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Bob, we're going to be talking tonight \n","about youth apprenticeship and tech prep, the co-op learning  \n","career academies.  And what features all those programs that deal \n","with this subject -- what are some of the features that every one of \n","these school-to-work programs might have that   are important?\n","\t     \n","\t     SECRETARY REICH:  Well, one thing that we've seen -- and \n","you and I have been working at this for a long time, and you much \n","longer than I -- we've seen that active involvement of the business \n","community is absolutely essential.  And I'm so delighted that we're \n","doing this in the headquarters of the Chamber of Commerce.  The \n","Chamber of Commerce of the United States is committed to doing these \n","kinds of programs -- training, education, retraining -- and we've \n","aimed to work very closely with the Chamber.\n","\t     \n","\t     The business community is going to be actively engaged \n","in developing almost an audit of the kind of jobs that are needed and \n","helping the educators, community colleges, technical institutions \n","develop curricula that are relevant for the jobs of the future.\n","\t     \n","\t     Communities have got to come together.  I mean, this is \n","one of the most important things.  You've got to have all of these \n","players in a community come together and work together and cooperate \n","together.  You know, too often we have the educators over here and \n","the business leaders over here, labor groups over here and everybody \n","is talking, but they're not really working together in a common \n","strategy.\n","\t     \n","\t     And the third and final ingredient I would say, Dick, \n","would be a commitment to excellence -- a commitment both to academic \n","excellence and also to skills development excellence.  This is not a \n","tracking program we're talking about for kids who are not going to \n","make it.  This is a program that every young person ought to be \n","eligible for.  If they want to go on beyond that to four-year \n","college, that's fine.  That ought to be permissible.  But we're \n","talking about the foundation of learning about jobs, the foundation \n","skills for on-the-job learning.\n","\t     \n","\t     And again, those are the critical components.  It's \n","already being done.\n","\t     \n","\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I think -- if I might just interject one \n","point based on my personal experience at home -- the business \n","community has a critical role to play, not simply in saying here are \n","the job skills that are needed and here's what ought to be taught, \n","but also in monitoring that excellence.  If you have the right sort \n","of partnership there, the people who are paying the taxes and who are \n","going to then be hiring the workers are not going to permit the \n","second-rate programs to survive if they have any way to shape and \n","influence them.  So I think that's very important.\n","\t     \n","\t     And when we try to, if you will, fill in the blanks at \n","the federal level, trying to set some standards and provide some \n","funds, one of the things that we want to be sure and do is to make \n","sure that the employer has a heavy amount of influence over the \n","quality of these programs, because that's really what's going to \n","determine whether the whole thing is worthwhile.\n","\t     \n","\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  That's great.  We've been talking, of \n","course, about school-to-work and also the jobs and economic recovery \n","program for this summer and fall.  But let's talk just a moment about \n","long-term school reform.  It's something especially close to me.  Mr. \n","President, I wonder if you would give us some of your ideas for the \n","communities out here on Goals 2000 legislation that I think will be \n","coming forth before too long.\n","\t     \n","\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, as you know, back when you and I \n","were both governors, we spent a lot of time working on our public \n","schools and we tried to be very candid with our people in saying that \n","a lot of these things were going to take some time to materialize.  \n","\t     \n","\t     I had a hand in writing the National Education Goals \n","that the governors drafted, along with representatives of President \n","Bush's administration back in 1989.  And what we're going to try to \n","do this year with your leadership is to introduce legislation in \n","Congress that will actually define the things that the national \n","government ought to do to try to help the local schools and the \n","children of this country and the adult learners, too, meet those \n","goals -- making sure that when -- by 2000, people show up for school \n","ready to learn; that we get a 90 percent on-time high school \n","graduation rate; that children at the 4th, 8th, and 12th grades are \n","confident in the subjects they're supposed to know; that they are \n","second to none in math and science; that are schools are safe, \n","disciplined, and drug-free.  And, of course, the fifth goal --I took \n","them out of line to say this the last -- is that we have a system of \n","life-long learning in this country.\n","\t     \n","\t     And each one of those goals there's a national role, a \n","state role, a school role, school district role, and a private sector \n","role.  And what you've attempted to do in this bill you're going to \n","introduce with me in the next few weeks is to define what our job is; \n","and then to give the rest of America a way of defining what their job \n","is and seeing whether we're actually meeting the standards of quality \n","that we need to meet.\n","\t     \n","\t     It's very exciting.  So far as I know, nothing quite \n","like it has ever been done in the form of federal legislation before.  \n","Not mandating and telling people what they have to do with their \n","money, but actually setting up a framework for excellence and \n","partnerships so that we can do our job.  I'm really excited about it.\n","\t     \n","\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, I am, too.  And I think really \n","it will be an entirely new role for the federal government in terms \n","of its relationship with states, serving as a partner really to \n","support and facilitate and to help out in these education reform \n","efforts, all driven by high standards.  That's the point.\n","\t     \n","\t     Bob, let me ask you one question, and then we'll get to \n","the telephone calls.  It's about the same subject.  We have, of \n","course, skills standards that are going to be part of Goals 2000, and \n","I wonder if you would comment on that.\n","\t     \n","\t     SECRETARY REICH:  Well, you know, we have 75 percent of \n","our young people who don't graduate from college.  Very often they \n","don't have very many alternatives.  They do have a wonderful system \n","of community colleges and technical institutions, but if we had \n","national skill standards to which they could aspire and which \n","employers would understand as a national credential, many of these \n","young people would actually find that they were much more eligible \n","for jobs.\n","\t     \n","\t     Everybody doesn't have to go to college.  Other \n","countries you have smaller proportions of their population going to \n","college, but you have a whole level of people who have certain \n","technical, preprofessional skills.  We can do it in this country.  If \n","you don't go to four-year college you're not a loser.  And we want to \n","develop those national skill standards.  We're going to be working \n","with the states, with the Education Department, with a lot of private \n","industry in developing those standards.  And I think they will be the \n","kinds of things that enable our vocational and technical and other \n","institutions to rally around, as well as our business community.\n","\t     \n","\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, that's great.  Why don't we go \n","ahead and go to the telephone.  We have a call, I see -- Mayor Bruce \n","Todd of Austin, Texas.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Yes, Mr. President and Mr. Secretary Reich and \n","Riley, we certainly appreciate the opportunity to join you today.  We \n","have some dedicated professionals and volunteers here in Austin who \n","have heard what you have said and are very appreciative.  Let me \n","simply say, amen to some of the comments made already.  We agree with \n","much of the tone that the Clinton administration has taken, and are \n","very supportive.  \n","\t     \n","\t     We have been successful here in Austin of tripling our \n","summer employment program over the last four years.  We expect to \n","have over 2,000 employed this year in the summertime; perhaps as much \n","as 3,500 with the federal assistance.  \n","\t     \n","\t     Much of the question that we had designed you have \n","answered in your opening comments, so we must be thinking alike.  But \n","the question essentially involved what initiatives after Labor Day \n","would be appropriate.  We know summertime is important.  Year-round \n","is even more important.  And what kind of initiatives at the federal \n","level might be proposed to meet the needs of the youth on a year-\n","round basis?  And perhaps more importantly, how can families and the \n","local community be more involved using the federal initiative? That's \n","something that we believe is very important to success in this \n","effort.\n","\t     \n","\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Mr. President.\n","\t     \n","\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I think I'll give everybody a chance to \n","answer the question, Bruce, but let me first thank you for calling, \n","and thank you for all the great work that you're doing in Austin.  \n","I've seen some of it and I've always been very impressed.  \n","\t     \n","\t     First, with regard to the summer program, we hope we can \n","structure it in a way that will enable us to continue the summer \n","program and that will move a lot of these young people back into \n","schools under circumstances that might allow them to do some work in \n","the private sector, too.  We hope that -- Secretary Reich is going to \n","try to set up a system where we create a lot of private sector jobs \n","to be matched with the public sector jobs this summer.  And we're \n","working on that.\n","\t     \n","\t     Secondly, in the program that I have presented to the \n","Congress over the next five years, what we are attempting to do is to \n","build in an amount of investment that's quite substantial for job \n","training programs, for school-to-work programs, all of which give \n","heavy, heavy weight to local community input -- just the question you \n","asked -- but do provide some federal investment dollars, which we \n","hope you can put with local dollars to keep people working and being \n","trained on a year-round basis.\n","\t     \n","\t     And I will say again, to echo what Secretary Reich said \n","a moment ago, to try to break down the barrier between what is seen \n","as work and what is seen as learning.  An awful lot of young people \n","actually have quite high IQs, but actually learn so much better when \n","they're doing than when they're reading or just listening.  So we \n","hope that the community involvement part of it will be permanent, and \n","we hope that if the whole budget passes -- and we do have 200 budget \n","cuts and more than 200, actually, in the budget -- and some revenue \n","raisers, and some new money for education and training, that we'll be \n","able to do just what you seem to want based on your question.\n","\t     \n","\t     Bob, do you want to say anything?\n","\t     \n","\t     SECRETARY REICH:  Well, you took most of the words out \n","of my mouth, Mr. President, as usual.  But let me just add one thing, \n","and that is that one of the most important aspects of post-high \n","school for a lot of young people who are not going on to college, in \n","addition to the school-to-work program, simply is the availability of \n","jobs.  And we've got to get this economy moving again, obviously.  \n","It's terribly important to get this recovery program, to get the \n","economy back on track.  That's sort of the prerequisite to everything \n","else.  If we don't get the economy back on track -- we have -- I \n","think this is the 16th -- correct me if I'm wrong, Mr. President -- I \n","think is the 16th month we have had seven percent unemployment or \n","greater.  This is a jobless recovery.  A lot of those kids are going \n","to be getting out of school in June.  And even if we did everything \n","right, they would have a very, very hard time getting jobs.\n","\t     \n","\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you both.  Of course, Goals 2000 \n","will be a permanent, long-term thing that will certainly reach into \n","next year.  It will involve, if passed -- and we certainly hope it \n","will be -- action plans with every state where we can be working \n","together to reach for the goals in a number of different ways.  And \n","then the state, with all the various school districts, a very \n","important part of that will be citizen and parent involvement.  And I \n","think everybody will see a great energy out there, once we get that \n","moving.\n","\t     \n","\t     The next call is Dr. Harry Heinemann, New York.  \n","\t     \n","\t     Doctor?\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Good evening, Mr. Secretary.  It is a pleasure to \n","be on with you this evening.  As you may know, bridging the school \n","and work has been central to La Guardia's educational program since \n","its inception in the 1970s, and that includes the college, the two \n","alternative high schools that operate on our campus, and the linkages \n","we have forged with the local schools.  We have found this to be an \n","extremely effective learning strategy.\n","\t     \n","\t     And over the years, we've come to believe that there are \n","several principles that are very important in bridging the school and \n","work.  And these include integrating theory in the classroom with \n","practice in the workplace, with providing all students early exposure \n","to careers, as well as providing opportunities for them to reflect \n","upon these experiences while they strengthen their skills; and \n","lastly, the critical role of the liberal arts, particularly in the \n","development of high performance competencies.  \n","\t     \n","\t     My question, then is:  How can the general education \n","faculty and the academic curriculum be more closely integrated with \n","transition to work experience?  And what mechanisms and strategies \n","can you suggest to achieve this integration?\n","\t     \n","\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, thank you very much.  I think -- \n","and we'll get a response from you all on that, and very interesting \n","work going on there.  We're going to have three people, our next \n","guests on the program this evening, that will be some specialists   \n","in that area that you're speaking, and I'll certainly pass that on to \n","them and we can discuss it later.\n","\t     \n","\t     You all care to comment -- any comments you might have?\n","\t     \n","\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I'd just like to say, if I might, one \n","thing.  I want to reemphasize this and I don't think I'm being as \n","clear about it as I'd like, although I think at least one of the \n","people who will be on the second panel will be able to say it more \n","explicitly than I.  I think this whole concept of applied academics \n","is very important.  And I think that we have to basically abolish \n","what I consider to be a very artificial distinction between what is \n","vocational learning and what is academic learning.\n","\t     \n","\t     I think we should keep the liberal arts going.  I think \n","we should have a strong component for people who are in the \n","vocational program.\n","\t     \n","\t     SECRETARY REICH:  It seems to me that we also need to \n","rethink our entire tracking system, because a lot of these school and \n","work combinations are important for mainstream students.  They're \n","important for all students.  It's not just a special group of \n","students that needs them.\n","\t     \n","\t     Some of the experiments that I've seen around the United \n","States -- Dick, I'm sure you've seen them as well -- are mainstream \n","experiments.  They're mainstreaming all the students.  At 11th and \n","12th grades they're giving them a combined work and school experience \n","and then a transition program.  And again, the kids can either go on \n","to college if they want; they can go on to technical community; they \n","can go on to an entirely -- a large variety of possibilities and \n","career directions.\n","\t     \n","\t     But we have to get away from the stigmatizing that often \n","goes on with young people who simply are doing job-related or work-\n","related work within the classroom, within our schools.\n","\t     \n","\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you, very much.  I think that's \n","going to be the last call that we have time for.  Mr. President, I \n","think you've got to move on to another matter, and I want to thank \n","you and Secretary Reich for being here.  We appreciate your time and \n","your ideas, and it's been a tremendous help to us.  \n","\n","\tClase: \n","talk.politics.misc\n","\n","\n","\tDocumento 3746: \n","THE WHITE HOUSE\n","\n","                  Office of the Press Secretary\n","                 (Vancouver, British Columbia) \n","______________________________________________________________\n","\n","\n","                       BACKGROUND BRIEFING\n","                               BY\n","                 SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS\n","\n","\n","                          April 4, 1993\n","\t     \n","                          Canada Place\n","                  Vancouver, British Columbia  \n","\n","\n","9:40 A.M. PST\n","\t     \n","\t     \n","\t     Folks, we're about to start the BACKGROUND BRIEFING \n","on the aid package.\n","\n","\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Good morning.  The \n","President -- President Clinton and President Yeltsin agreed \n","yesterday on a series of American initiatives to support economic \n","and political reform in Russia, and it's valued at $1.6 billion.  \n","\n","\t     Before taking your questions and running through the \n","basic outlines of this package, I want to make a few points.  \n","First, this is the maximum that the Clinton administration can do \n","with available funds to support Russian reform.  All of the funds \n","have been allocated and appropriated by the Congress.  There is \n","no need for the administration to go back to the Congress to fund \n","any of these programs.  All our Fiscal Year '93 funds currently \n","are available, so in effect, all of these programs can begin \n","tomorrow.\n","\t     \n","\t     The second point is that this package is designed to \n","support Russian reformers.  All of the initiatives in the package \n","are directed at reformers and for their benefit, and all have \n","been worked out with prior consultation with the Russian \n","government.\n","\t     \n","\t     Third, the President is determined that we will \n","deliver on these commitments this year.  The package is designed \n","to maximize our ability to support reform.  In designing it we \n","wanted to avoid making commitments that we could not meet, and we \n","feel very confident that we can meet all of these commitments in \n","front of you.\n","\t     \n","\t     Fourth, I'd like to note the special importance of \n","trade and investment.  I think it's fair to say that Russia's \n","capital and technology needs throughout the next decade extend \n","well into the hundreds of billions of dollars.  No collection of \n","governments can meet those needs; only the private sector can do \n","so.  And so the President and President Yeltsin agreed to make \n","trade and investment a major priority in the relationship.  \n","\t     \n","\t     They also agreed that there would be a new joint \n","commission on energy and space formed, headed on the U.S. side by \n","Vice President Gore; on the Russian side by Prime Minister \n","Chernomyrdin.  And the goal of this effort is to break through \n","the barriers to trade and investment on both sides and to promote \n","a vastly expanded relationship.\n","\t     \n","\t     If it would be helpful I'd be prepared to run down \n","the first page, which is a summary of U.S. assistance, and just \n","give you some general background on what these programs are.  \n","I'll do it quickly and then I'll be glad to take questions.\n","\t     \n","\t     The first group of initiatives are humanitarian food \n","and medical assistance.  This is part of our effort which has \n","been underway for several years to provide basic humanitarian \n","grant food assistance so that the Russian government can assure \n","there's at least a minimal amount of bread on the shelves in the \n","major cities.  That's $194 million in grant -- that is from Food \n","for Progress, the grant portion of Food for Progress.  We'll also \n","be continuing our grant assistance in medicines and \n","pharmaceutical supplies, and that's $30 million.\n","\t     \n","\t     The second item is concessional food sales.  As you \n","know, the United States has had a long-term grain relationship \n","with Russia.  It's important to us and it's important to Russia \n","that we continue that relationship.  The President has chosen the \n","Food for Progress program which is a concessional loan program.  \n","The value over the next seven months is $700 million.  These are \n","concessional terms.  The exact terms have not been worked out, \n","but I think it's fair to say there will be a grace period on \n","principal of six or seven years, and concessional rates \n","thereafter for the life of the deal.\n","\t     \n","\t     The third program is a collection of private sector \n","support.  We think this is one of the most important things we're \n","going to do.  Privatization and the creation of small businesses \n","is the number one priority of the reform government in Moscow.  \n","And so the President has decided to create a Russian-American \n","enterprise fund capitalized this year at $50 million.  And the \n","goal of this fund is to make direct loans to small businesses in \n","Russia, to take equity positions in those businesses.  \n","\t     \n","\t     The President has also decided to create a \n","privatization fund which would work directly with the Russian \n","government in its priority objective of trying to convert state \n","enterprises from a state-owned basis to a private basis.  He has \n","also agreed -- the President has also agreed to establish a \n","Eurasia foundation.  This would be a private foundation led by \n","prominent Americans to fund democratization projects in Russia.\n","\t     \n","\t     The fourth grouping you see there in the summary \n","page is democratization itself.  I think it's fair to say that \n","this administration has given a new impetus to the goal of \n","pursuing democratization in Russia.  You see that we have a total \n","of $48 million in programs, various programs.  The detailed \n","tables give an indication of some of the programs that we're \n","launching.  \n","\t     \n","\t     The President is also calling for the development of \n","a democracy corps, which will be an overarching umbrella group to \n","try to incorporate all of the disparate private and public \n","efforts now underway from the United States to support reform in \n","Russia.\n","\t     \n","\t     The fifth program you see is Russian office of \n","resettlement.  This is a new initiative created and \n","conceptualized by this administration.  This is a demonstration \n","project.  What we'd like to do is work with the Russian military \n","to help resettle Russian officers returning from the Baltic \n","states and other parts of the former Soviet Union.  We want to \n","make sure that we work out the best way to do that, whether it's \n","with Russian labor and Russian materials or using prefab American \n","construction.  And so we've decided to fund on a demonstration \n","basis the construction of 450 housing units.  We'll be working \n","very closely with the Russian military on this.  And I would say \n","that we have a long-term commitment to this project.  \n","\t     \n","\t     The sixth area is energy in the environment.  They \n","are two issues that the President feels strongly about.  Our \n","initial efforts will be feasibility studies to look into the \n","possibility of enhancing their energy production, both oil and \n","gas; and equally important trying to cut down on the leakages in \n","the oil and gas pipeline systems, which cause so much \n","environmental damage.\n","\t     \n","\t     I've talked a little bit about trade and investment, \n","about the new group being created that the Vice President will \n","chair on our side.  Secretary Ron Brown will also be cochairing \n","with Deputy Prime Minister Shohkin, a business development \n","committee, which will work in all other sectors of the economy, \n","to break down the many barriers that currently exist and impede \n","trade and investment.  We are also going to appoint a full-time \n","investment ombudsman in the American government to work on this \n","problem full-time.  \n","\t     \n","\t     And the point I'd like to make here is, trade and \n","investment in the 1990s is every bit as important, to draw an \n","analogy, as arms reductions was in the '70s and '80s.  And we \n","just thought that in looking at this we needed to make a \n","commitment within our own government to have people work on it -- \n","senior people on a full-time basis, because it is terribly \n","important.\n","\t     \n","\t     You'll notice that the United States is going to \n","support Russia's membership in the GATT.  Russia has had observer \n","status.  Russia has requested our support and, in fact, requested \n","our advice in becoming a member of the GATT.  We think that the \n","long-term goal of drawing Russia into the global economy is \n","paramount, a very important goal.  And that is why we are \n","supporting the membership in the GATT.  We are also supporting \n","their access to GSP, the Generalized System of Preferences.  \n","\t     \n","\t     You'll note that Ex-Im has extended $82 million in \n","credit for a caterpillar deal in Siberia, that OPIC has extended \n","$150 million in credits and loan guarantees for a Conoco oil \n","project.  I'd like to emphasize that we are very close to an \n","agreement between Russia and the United States for a $2-billion \n","framework facility through the Ex-Im Bank that would finance \n","Russian purchases of American oil and gas equipment and services. \n","We think this is a very important development.  We think we'll \n","get there by April 14th, which is the opening day of the Tokyo \n","conference, the G-7 conference.\n","\t     \n","\t     Before I take any further questions, I'd like to \n","defer to my colleague, who will review the security assistance \n","objectives with you.\n","\t     \n","\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Our major \n","unfinished agenda with the Russians and with their counterparts \n","in Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Belarus is in the area of the safe and \n","secure dismantlement of the nuclear arsenals on their territory \n","under the terms of the START I and START II agreements.   \n","Recently we completed in Moscow three, I think, very important \n","agreements that devote a significant chunk of Nunn-Lugar funding \n","to three important programs.  The first is the program of $130 \n","million for the strategic nuclear delivery vehicle dismantlement \n","program.  That is for submarines, for ICBM dismantlement and for \n","bomber dismantlement -- $130 million.\n","\t     \n","\t     The second is a $75 million tranche of funding for \n","the construction of a facility to store nuclear materials removed \n","from the warheads as they are dismantled.  This will essentially \n","contribute to the overall design and the early phases of the \n","construction of that storage facility.  \n","\t     \n","\t     And finally, a $10-million tranche of money to help \n","in the establishment of a monitoring system for the nuclear \n","materials as they are withdrawn from the weapons system.  So we \n","add that $215-million total to the extant Nunn-Lugar assistance \n","which has been flowing -- about $150 million for some overall \n","safety improvements for various kinds of equipment and safety \n","measures that we have been working out with the Russians over the \n","last couple of years.  \n","\t     \n","\t     So this is an area where we will be going a lot more \n","work with not only the Russians but with the Ukrainians, Kazhaks, \n","and Belarussians.  Belarus, for example, has just, in the last \n","couple of weeks, received up to $65 million in FY'93 funds for \n","safety, security and dismantlement programs on Belarussian \n","territory.  And this was in the wake of their ratification of \n","START I, an agreement to accede to NPT. \n","\t     \n","\t     So we are working very hard with all the parties to \n","the Lisbon protocols, and will continue to work very hard with \n","them.  And I look upon these three recent agreements with Russia \n","as a very important step in that process.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  The OPIC funds to -- is that for the field in \n","Kazhakstan -- and Conoco already signed this deal with \n","Kazhakstan.  Why do you feel now it is necessary -- if it's the \n","same one, why do you feel it's necessary?\n","\t     \n","\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  It's not the same \n","deal.  Chevron signed a deal with Kazhakstan, the Tenges oil \n","field.  This is a new investment project.  It's a polar lights \n","oil development and renovation project, and it's being announced \n","today.  So it's completely new.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Can you tell us more about what's involved?\n","\t     \n","\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Yes.  Conoco, like \n","other American oil companies has been searching for ways to do \n","two things.  One, to prospect for new oil in Siberia, west \n","Siberia; and two, to try to get into the business of renovating \n","oil wells and renovating pipelines, both oil and gas, in Russia.  \n","The objective here, obviously, is to take advantage of the \n","natural resources in Russia, increase energy production, which \n","will, in turn, increase hard currency revenues, which is what \n","Russia needs.\n","\t     \n","\t     So we think this deal is very, very good development \n","for Russia.  The Russians do as well, and it's good for an \n","American company.  And the American government has played a \n","leading role in pulling this together through the credit facility \n","in OPIC and through the loan guarantee.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  So it's to search and also to renovate fields \n","that are already there?\n","\t     \n","\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  That's right.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  On that point, should other American companies \n","expect to get administration support for such deals, or should \n","they now go to the Ex-Im and try to get the money out of the $2 \n","billion?\n","\t     \n","\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, as you know, \n","Ex-Im is part of the U.S. government and various parts of the \n","U.S. government have been pushing, including the State Department \n","and the White House for this deal to be consummated.  And we \n","think it will.  And if we arrive at this agreement by April 14th, \n","there will be $2 billion in financing available for American \n","companies to sell their equipment and sell their services.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  That should take up all of the rest of the \n","deals and their won't be -- and their will or there won't be \n","support for OPIC sort of deals such as this Conoco?\n","\t     \n","\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  There's a \n","tremendous amount of interest on the part of American oil and gas \n","companies to invest in Russia.  We think that the Ex-Im oil and \n","gas facility, the $2-billion facility, once it is concluded, will \n","soak up a lot of that interest.  But I think the interest may \n","even extend beyond that.  And if so, the government will respond.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  What's the current year budget costs of that \n","$2-billion agreement should it go forward?  And is there any \n","current year budget costs --\n","\t     \n","\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I'll have to refer \n","you to Ex-Im for that.  I don't know the details of that.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  The concessional food sales -- is there any \n","current year costs to that, or is it delayed until the years in \n","which the payments are due?\n","\t     \n","\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  The concessional \n","food sales are from Food for Progress, which is a USDA program.  \n","USDA has the funds, we don't need to go back to the Congress to \n","expend those funds.  There will be a hit in the budget.  I'd \n","refer you to USDA and OMB for the details on that.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Can you talk about the Democracy Corps?\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t     and the private sector -- how many folks are \n","going to be involved in that?\n","\t     \n","\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Why don't I start \n","with the Democracy Corps first.  I think the administration felt \n","coming into office that there were literally thousands of \n","organization, private organizations in the United States that in \n","one way or another were working at the goal of trying to achieve \n","democratization in Russia, helping on a farmer-to-farmer basis.  \n","And there were literally 10 or 15 U.S. government agencies that \n","had a variety of programs in this area.  And so the \n","administration felt -- the President felt it was important to try \n","to draw all of these initiatives together under one group to give \n","some coherence to the efforts and to give some impetus to the \n","efforts.  And so this is a presidential initiative.\n","\t     \n","\t     It will be headed by Ambassador Tom Simons who will \n","soon take up his duties as the coordinator for U.S. assistance in \n","the former Soviet Union.  And we're very hopeful that we might \n","use this Democracy Corps not only to draw upon the resources of \n","our own government, but the resources of the American private \n","sector and schools and communities across the nation.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t     any kind of commitment yet, any kind of word \n","yet on FY'94, and any new money that needs to be appropriated \n","besides the $300 million the President talked about?\n","\t     \n","\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  The administration \n","is requesting additional funds in FY'94 of $700 million.  What \n","the President has done this weekend is to consult really \n","intensively yesterday with President Yeltsin about additional \n","measures the United States could take in some of these areas to \n","support reform.  He'll be consulting with the Congress.  When he \n","returns to Washington, he'll be consulting also with the other \n","ally governments, and we'll make a decision at that time.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Two questions about the $700 billion \n","agricultural money.  First of all, I thought it was the sort of \n","consensus that what Russia did not need was more loans for food.  \n","So why did you decide to do it that way?  Secondly, could you \n","explain -- agriculture has been stopped from making further loans \n","for food because of Russia's inability to pay.  How does this fit \n","into that situation?\n","\t     \n","\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  As you know, the \n","United States for a long time has been a major supplier of grains \n","and food commodities, agricultural products to Russia.  I think \n","between 1991 and '92 we had extended -- a little bit of history \n","here -- about $5.5 billion in credits, credit guarantees, through \n","the Commodity Credit Corporation.  That was the principal vehicle \n","to ensure the sale of American grain products.  On December 1 of \n","last year, '92, the Russian government stopped its payments on \n","that program.  They are now in arrears to us on that program, and \n","therefore, by law, the United States cannot continue that \n","program.  And so the President, working with Secretary Espy and \n","other officials in the Cabinet, looked for other ways that we \n","could promote American grain sales.  \n","\t     \n","\t     And I think we have two ways to do that.  We've \n","announced today $194 million in grant food assistance through the \n","Food for Progress program.  But we do not have sufficient \n","authority to spend $700 million in grant food, and so we looked \n","for a concessional loan program.  \n","\t     \n","\t     I think everybody agrees that Russia -- that a \n","short-term loan program for Russia would not make sense now, but \n","a long-term concessional loan program would.  And that is what \n","this program is.  It will provide, once the final details are \n","worked out, for a six to seven-year grace period on payments of \n","principal.  And then from years seven through 15, which is the \n","life of the deal, it will provide for concessional rates of \n","interest -- generally around three to four percent.  And so we \n","believe and the Russian government believes this is a good deal \n","for them because it will avoid the imperative of early payments \n","and put them into the out years, but it will also continue this \n","very important grain relationship, which is important for them, \n","and it's important for the American farm community.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  I gather from what you say that this could make \n","it explicit -- the Russians' failure to pay the interest on ECC \n","loan does not in any way affect this kind of loan going through, \n","is that right? \n","\t     \n","\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Let me be explicit \n","about that.  We are prevented under the law to from continuing  \n","the Commodity Credit Corporation short-term credit program \n","because of Russia's arrearages to the United States.  All of you \n","know about those arrearages.  They total about, I think, around \n","$640 million.  USDA can give you an exact figure.  So having \n","taken that into consideration and wanting to preserve American \n","market share and a long-term grain relationship, wanting to \n","respond to a specific request from the Russian government for \n","major food assistance, knowing that we couldn't take it from the \n","grant programs because we don't have sufficient authority there, \n","we looked at Food for Progress, which is a program we've used to \n","great effect in other parts of the world.  And we consulted with \n","the Russian government and arrived at this solution.  \n","\t     \n","\t     I think the Russians are pleased because it provides \n","them with the food, but also gives them a little bit of relief on \n","the short-term payments.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Where do those funds actually come from?\n","\t     \n","\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  They come from the \n","Food for Progress program, which is a program under USDA's \n","authority.  USDA has the authority to spend these funds.  We do \n","not need to go back to the Congress for these funds.  And I want \n","to make that general point again:  Everything in this package, \n","the $1.6 billion package, comprises funds that have already been \n","allocated and appropriated by the Congress.  The administration \n","can begin to spend these monies tomorrow.  And it's very \n","important in our eyes that we expend all the funds this year, \n","that we meet these commitments.  And we are confident we'll be \n","able to do so.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  How did you arrive at the figure of $700 \n","million -- does that max out that program, or did you actually \n","have a range from 0 to --\n","\t     \n","\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  There's a reason \n","for it.  The reason was that the Russian government told us \n","that's about the amount of grain that they needed between now and \n","harvest time.  And so the idea is that we would begin the \n","shipments probably $100 million per month from now until the \n","harvest in the autumn, at which time Russia won't require the \n","same level of food imports from the West.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  I would imagine there's going to be some \n","considerable envy and jealousy on the part of some of the other \n","republics because of the size and the scope of this with Russia.  \n","Have you given any consideration to advancing negotiations for \n","the same kinds of projects with the Ukraine, with Georgia , with \n","some of the other republics?\n","\t     \n","\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Yes, we're very \n","conscience of the fact that we also have an interest in extending \n","American support to the 11 other countries of the former Soviet \n","Union.  We have told ourselves, and we have planned that in the \n","area of technical assistance, the grant technical assistance that \n","you see, roughly 50 percent of the funding will go to Russia and \n","roughly 50 percent to the other countries. \n","\t     \n","\t     In the area of food sales, we have been active with \n","Ukraine, in grant food assistance with Georgia and Armenia.  We \n","will continue that.  And I think it's fair to say that after this \n","summit we will go back and look at all of our programs with the \n","other countries to ensure that they are adequate and they are \n","productive and they're hard-hitting.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Has anything happened at the summit to lead \n","American energy companies and other companies to believe that \n","Russia is going to be more user-friendly toward them in terms of \n","taxing, legalities, bureaucracy?\n","\t     \n","\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, one of our \n","primary objectives coming into this summit was to highlight,  not \n","only the economic agenda, but also trade and investment.  And I'd \n","like to refer to the point I made at the beginning.  We're \n","convinced in talking about this problem -- the problem of how to \n","support Russia long-term -- we're convinced that no collection of \n","Western governments have the financial resources over the next \n","decade to fuel the continuation of reform, that only the private \n","sector can do that.  \n","\t     \n","\t     We look at our own society and we see tremendous \n","capability in resources in the oil and gas sector.  It is a very \n","good match with what the Russians need now, which is financial \n","investment in the existing oil and gas wells and pipeline and new \n","technology and new capital to finance new production.  \n","\t     \n","\t     That's what the Russian government has told us it \n","wants to do, and so that's why we have made such a major emphasis \n","on it.  That's why trade and investment was a prominent issue on \n","the first day of these talks, and in fact, figured prominently \n","last night in the meeting between President Yeltsin and President \n","Clinton.  And we're hoping that together we might send a strong \n","signal to the American business community that we support their \n","efforts to invest in Russia, that the United States, through Ex-\n","Im and OPEC and the Department of Commerce, will be there to \n","support them.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  My question is, is Yeltsin in any position to \n","deliver on making Russia a more --\n","\t     \n","\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We think he is.  I \n","would note that President Yeltsin's Prime Minister, Mr. \n","Chernomyrdin, worked for 30 years in the Russian oil and gas \n","sector.  He will now chair a high-level commission with the Vice \n","President, Vice President Gore, to try to break through the \n","barriers that currently exist to Western investment in the oil \n","and gas sector.  We believe we have a commitment to make that \n","committee an important committee.  And we're looking forward to \n","the work.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  What type of mechanism is already in place to \n","administer the private sector portion of the program?  And will \n","the U.S. be directly involved in the tail end of distribution of \n","the actual funds or is the money simply turned over to the \n","Russian government for distribution at their will?\n","\t     \t    \n","\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Are you talking \n","about the variety of programs listed here?  It depends on the \n","program itself.  In most cases, though, we are either working \n","through American PBOs or American government agencies to ensure \n","that the money obviously is well spent, that the money gets to \n","the intended source.  That's an obligation we have to the \n","Congress to ensure the money is well spent and that we can \n","account for the money.  We have done that in the last couple of \n","months intensively and we will continue to do it for each of \n","these programs.\n","\t     \n","\t     But they are all quite different.  For instance, in \n","the area of grant food and medical assistance, for grant food it \n","is carried out through USDA and USDA accounts for the delivery of \n","the food.  For grant medical assistance, we've been working \n","through Project Hope which is a private organization.  For the \n","housing -- for instance, the resettlement of Russian officers, \n","we'll be working with a group of American PBOs.  On some of the \n","democratization projects, we're working directly with Russian \n","private individuals and private foundations.  We're working with \n","journalists in Russia on a media project that you may have \n","noticed.\n","\t     \n","\t     So we literally have here 30 to 40 different \n","activities under all these rubrics and they're all going to be \n","carried out in slightly different ways.  Some directly with the \n","Russian government, some with Russian citizens.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  The Jackson-Vanik restrictions that remain and \n","on the COCOM restrictions that remain, can you tell us what the \n","President has to do on that?\n","\t     \n","\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, as George \n","noted yesterday, President Yeltsin raised these as irritants in \n","the relationship.  The President has noted that.  I think it's \n","fair to say we will go back now in our own government when we \n","return to Washington and look at both of these questions, and \n","we'll get back to the Russian government.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  You were not prepared for these questions when \n","you got here?\n","\t     \n","\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We were prepared \n","for these questions.  We've looked at them.  But we're not \n","prepared to make a quick decision this weekend.  They require --\n","let me just explain, particularly on Jackson-Vanik.  They require \n","consultation with the Congress.  They require consultation with \n","the American Jewish community.  And we're very sensitive to those \n","concerns.  And so we'll want to go back and talk to them before \n","we take any action.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Is this package designed so that you will not \n","have to go to Congress for anything at this point?\n","\t     \n","\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  As I said at the \n","beginning, the advantage of this particular package is that all \n","the funds have been allocated and appropriated by the Congress.  \n","So the administration will not have to go back to the Congress to \n","seek any additional authority to fund any of these efforts.  In \n","effect, they can all begin tomorrow, and I know that many of the \n","agencies responsible for these projects will begin tomorrow.  And \n","that's the advantage of this particular initiative.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  If this, as the President says, is a long-term, \n","long-haul thing, and members of Congress are at this moment \n","heading for Moscow, why aren't you talking about going to \n","Congress and suggesting to the President of Russia that you are \n","prepared to go to Congress for various things?\n","\t     \n","\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think we've been \n","clear about that.  The President is discussing this weekend with \n","President Yeltsin some additional ideas that we have for American \n","funding of additional projects, and ideas that he has.  We have a \n","major congressional delegation that left last night, headed by \n","Representative Gephardt and we'll want to consult with that \n","delegation and other members of Congress before doing anything.  \n","And we'll also want to consult with our allies.  So that's where \n","it stands now.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  We've been told repeatedly that a number of \n","these items represent different or new ways of spending the money \n","already appropriated.  Could you just tick off which of these \n","items represents reprogramming or at least spending money in ways \n","that it was not previously set to be?\n","\t     \n","\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think that we've \n","said that these are all projects that either Congress had \n","allocated money for through the Freedom Support Act; there were \n","some funds that were left over from FY'92.  And this \n","administration took office and had some new ideas about how the \n","funds might be expended.\n","\t     \n","\t     We didn't use just the Freedom Support Act funds or \n","the FY'92 funds.  We went into some of the agency allocations --\n","Ex-Im, OPIC, and USDA -- and tried to look for creative ways to \n","further our programs.\n","\t     \n","\t     And example of that is the Food for Progress \n","concessional loans.  We had hit a brick wall with another type of \n","funding through USDA.  We could not go forward legally, and so we \n","looked for a more creative way to ensure continued American \n","market share and ensure continued grain sales, and we think we \n","found it.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Where, for example, are you getting the money \n","for this Russian officer resettlement --\n","\t     \n","\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  That's from the \n","Freedom Support Act funds.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  In other words, all of the money is being \n","directly spent in new ways, so to speak --\n","\t     \n","\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Most of the grant \n","projects that you see -- if you look at the general chart, the \n","second chart, it's broken down into grant and credits.  And if \n","you look under grants, the technical cooperation projects that \n","total $281.9 million -- that is almost all Freedom Support Act \n","funding.  A little bit of it is leftover funds from fiscal year \n","'92.  The Nunn-Lugar funds, of course, you know about the \n","legislative history of those funds.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t     cooperation --\n","\t     \n","\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  From FY '92?  I \n","don't have the exact figure.  It was not a considerable figure.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Could you tell us please, has anything happened \n","here this weekend that will break the log jam between Ukraine and \n","Russia over START -- for START I and II as a result of what's \n","happened here --\n","\t     \n","\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Both presidents, \n","President Yeltsin and President Clinton, will be discussing this \n","issue this morning.  In fact, we haven't yet gotten to security \n","and arms control related issues.  That will be this morning's \n","session.  I know that President Clinton will be very strongly \n","reinforcing that this is a top priority for us.  We've been \n","talking to the Russians and the Ukrainians over the last couple \n","of weeks about ways that we might help to facilitate the \n","discussions between them.  Up to this point, this has been a very \n","important negotiation that's been going on essentially between \n","Moscow and Kiev.  And we are at the point now of essentially \n","discussing with them if there are ways that we could contribute \n","to this discussion, help to move things forward essentially.  \n","\t     \n","\t     But in terms of what is coming out of this weekend, \n","I don't yet know.  In a couple hours we'll know.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q?\t    Just a follow-up on the financing here.  Is \n","any of this robbing Peter to pay Boris -- since it's all current \n","year appropriations, have you taken it from anyplace that's been \n","earmarked and put it into this fund?\n","\t     \n","\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  There are smoke and \n","mirrors here, and I think it's an important point to note.  We \n","could have given you a page of assistance numbers that included \n","out-year funding.  We're going to make a long-term commitment to \n","many of these projects -- for instance, the enterprise funds, the \n","privatization effort, the housing effort.  And we've already \n","talked to the Russians about our long-term commitment.  \n","\t     \n","\t     We could have put in really big numbers and this \n","could have been a bigger package, but we wanted to make a point:  \n","This package is FY '93.  It's funds that we have.  And we're \n","going to do what we say we're going to do.  And the President \n","feels very strongly about that.  In the past there is a legacy \n","that the western governments, the combination of governments, put \n","up large budget figures and for any number of reasons we're not \n","able to meet them, we're determined, and the President is \n","determined, to carry out every single program in this package.  \n","And we'll do it.  \n","\t     \n","\t     But we do have a longer-term commitment, and that's \n","part of the discussions on economics this weekend.  We're looking \n","for Russian ideas on what it is we can do to most effectively \n","support reform.  And we've told them that we do have a commitment \n","on some of these programs beyond this fiscal year.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t     taken it way from any --\n","\t     \n","\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, we haven't.  \n","Okay, the question is, have we reprogrammed any of these funds; \n","so have we taken it from other countries to pay for programs in \n","Russia?  The answer is no, we have not done so.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  In terms of funding, there is no available \n","monies left -- and you simply find a creative way to find money \n","somewhere else.  Doesn't that, in fact, support the -- theory?\n","\t     \n","\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Not at all.  I \n","don't think it does.  That's a particular example, and the \n","example is grain sales.  The Commodity Credit Corporation credit \n","guarantee program was short-term loans that Russia had to pay \n","back within 12 to 15 months.  You all know about Russia's debt \n","problem, and Russia was unable to meet those commitments.  So we \n","looked for a way to do two things:  to meet Russia's requirement \n","for grain.  They're a net grain importer on a massive scale, and \n","also meet our objective of making sure that the American farmers \n","have a chance to sell their products to Russia.  And we simply \n","look for another way to finance that.  And we have legislative \n","authority to do it.  This program has been successful in other \n","areas.  We had not tried it before in the former Soviet Union, \n","but we thought we should now.\n","\t     \t  \n","\t     Q\t  Isn't this really the Bush-Clinton aid package \n","for Russia, since these funds were really first derived by \n","initiatives put forward by President Bush?\n","\t     \n","\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, I don't think \n","that's a fair characterization.  A lot of these funds were \n","appropriated by the U.S. Congress is 1991, in 1992.  This \n","administration took office and inherited some obligations that \n","the Bush administration had made.  But we had a long six to seven \n","week review of this program.  We decided to meet the commitments \n","that had been made by the previous administration.  \n","\t     \n","\t     But we have gone well beyond them in funding the \n","enterprise fund, which was just an idea, but the idea had not \n","been filled out with a program.  There was no number attached to \n","it.  In grouping together some projects and trying to make them \n","into a coherent whole in the privatization effort, I would say, \n","is another Clinton initiative.  \n","\t     \n","\t     Further, we listened to the Russian government and \n","listened to the Russian military who told us that the \n","resettlement of their officers was important to them for \n","political and economic and social reasons.  And President Clinton \n","has responded to that.  And we are making a long-term commitment \n","that beyond this demonstration project we're going to figure out \n","a way to do much more in trying to settle those officers.  \n","\t     \n","\t     I would also say that the President has given \n","impetus to all of us in the agencies to think much more broadly \n","about what it is we can do on democratization, because there we \n","have some experience and some comparative advantage that lends \n","itself to the Russian experience.  And in calling for the \n","creation of a democracy corps, which is another new initiative, \n","we're hopeful that we can take the resources of the private \n","sector as well as the American government, to achieve that \n","objective.  \n","\t     \n","\t     So I would not characterize it that way at all.  And \n","as most of you know, I am a career civil servant.  I was in the \n","last administration.  I'm very familiar with what the last \n","administration did.  And I would characterize this as a Clinton \n","assistance package for Russia.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  There's been a lot of criticism that aid in the \n","past has not gotten to the people.  Is there anything in this \n","outside of the ombudsman, that will guarantee that this money \n","will not just disappear because it's being administered by the \n","Russian government?\n","\t     \n","\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think that -- I \n","know that the President and other senior officials of our \n","government are concerned that American money be spent wisely and \n","that it get to the source that it's intended -- for which it's \n","intended.  And so we're going to take great care -- AID and the \n","State Department will take great care in making sure that the \n","funds are expended properly and that they're reaching their \n","source.\n","\t     \n","\t     I would not that this package is not simply a \n","package of support solely to the Russian government.  Some of \n","these projects, especially in democratization and exchanges, are \n","going to be worked out directly with Russian private individuals, \n","with businesses.  The private enterprise support is another \n","example of that.\n","\t     \n","\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  If I could just add \n","a word on this point with regard to the SSD-related programs, one \n","area that we've been looking at very, very closely is \n","consideration of actually using Russian firms in subcontracting \n","for these kinds of programs.  They would be working very closely, \n","of course, with the American firms, who would be the prime \n","contractors.  But this is a fine example, I think, of a more --of \n","a imaginative and flexible approach toward getting some of that \n","funding down to the grassroots level, down to the ground in \n","Russia; but at the same time ensuring that it is spent \n","efficiently and for the purposes for which it was intended.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  When would the democracy corps start?  Exactly \n","when do you see this happening?  How would get it off the ground?\n","\t     \n","\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, the President \n","is today calling for the creation of a democracy corps.  I think \n","it's fair to say that we're going to work out its framework over \n","the next couple of weeks.  Ambassador Simons takes up his duties \n","on May 1st.  But in effect we've already started, because over \n","the last couple of weeks the administration has begun to reach \n","out to people in the private sector who have come to us asking us \n","to help facilitate their activities in Russia.  And we've said \n","that we will be helpful.  We've also tried to kind of coordinate \n","in a much more effective way the activities of our own \n","government.  We do have 10 or 15 agencies that are active in \n","Russia in one way or another.  We think it makes sense to draw \n","them together and to focus their efforts.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Excuse me.  How much of this $1.6 billion will \n","actually be spent in the United States by American made goods?\n","\t     \n","\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I don't have any \n","figures for you now, but perhaps we could try to work something \n","up in the next couple of days on that.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  This figure is larger than the figure that has \n","been in the press -- did this program grow yesterday as a result \n","of the discussions, or have we just been that far off the mark?\n","\t     \n","\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, I think --\n","unfortunately the press has been a little bit off the mark, and \n","I'm sorry to say that.  No, this package -- President Clinton put \n","us to work about seven weeks ago on this package.  And he was \n","briefed intensively on this.  He contributed a lot of the \n","intellectual leadership in this package.  He contributed a lot of \n","the ideas in the package.  And I think it's fair to say that we \n","had this rough package worked out about two weeks ago.  We have \n","been refining it ever since.  We spent a couple of days last week \n","going over it with the Russian government, both the embassy in \n","Washington and the government in Moscow through our own embassy.  \n","And so it's been evolving.  But this particular package has been \n","together for about two weeks.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Where is Yeltsin's input into this then?  There \n","was so much talk before about the President wanted to get \n","Yeltsin's views about specifically what was needed and so forth.  \n","Is that in the out years?\n","\t     \n","\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, it's both.  \n","President Yeltsin has on several occasions told us, for instance, \n","that support for the creation of private businesses is important \n","to him; that the resettlement of Russian military officers is \n","important; and that first and foremost the effort to privatize \n","the state industries is important to them.  \n","\t     \n","\t     And so what we did was to try to make those the \n","centerpiece of our technical assistance part o the package.  We \n","listened to him.  On the privatization effort, we have been \n","working with the Russian government for months on this trying to \n","work out all the details.  So the Russian government on most of \n","these programs was involved every step of the way.  \n","\t     \n","\t     But let me get at the other part of your question.  \n","The President is also using this weekend to talk about a broader \n","set of initiatives that we might undertake.  And we're looking \n","for his ideas.  The President has brought his own ideas to the \n","table -- for instance, on energy and the environment and in \n","housing.  But we're looking for Russian ideas not.  We need to \n","consult with the Congress; and we need to consult with the other \n","allied governments that are also active.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  There's essentially nothing that happened in \n","the last day and a half that measurably altered the package that \n","you came in with?\n","\t     \n","\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  This particular \n","package, as I said, was worked out and was ready about two weeks \n","ago.  We have since then consulted with the Russian government on \n","the final stages of its development, and so this weekend we've \n","primarily talked about future, about what more the United States \n","and other Western countries can do to support reform in Russia, \n","which is our base objective here.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  I noticed that you -- that money appropriated \n","to train bankers and businessmen and officers.  Can you tell me \n","what about job training for workers who are displaced by \n","privatization?\n","\t     \n","\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  You're right; we \n","have a program to train Russian -- young Russians in banking and \n","financial services in the United States.  Part of the housing \n","initiative, it's not just to build housing units, it's to retrain \n","Russian officers who are retiring into other professions.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t     money for job training for workers whose \n","jobs are disappearing because of privatization --\n","\t     \n","\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We have not yet \n","allocated any money for that.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Why not?\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t     of the $6 million is going to build 450 \n","housing units.  Isn't that a lot of money per unit given what the \n","Western dollar will buy in the former Soviet Union?\n","\t     \n","\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  If you want to do \n","housing the right way, it's not just the building the framework \n","of a house, you've got to think about all the utilities.  You've \n","got to think about the purchase of land.  You've got to think \n","about sewage and gas and electricity and so forth.  And it's also \n","retraining.  It's not enough to put retired -- an officer coming \n","out of -- Riga or Tallin or Vilnius in a house in western Russia.  \n","We think we have an obligation to try to retrain those officers \n","as well.  This is responding to a request from the Russian \n","government.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t     of the $6 million will go to retrain --\n","\t     \n","\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  That's right.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Are you talking about apartment buildings or \n","single --\n","\t     \n","\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We're talking about \n","single, individual dwellings.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  You're saying that only 450 families will be \n","served by this?\n","\t     \n","\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  What I want to -- I \n","thought I pointed out earlier, this is a demonstration project.  \n","What we didn't want to do -- given the experience that the \n","Germans and the Turks and the Italians have had in building \n","housing in western Russian, we did not want to leap into it with \n","a huge amount of money.  What we want to do is work over the next \n","couple of months and try to figure out with American \n","organizations in the private sector the best way to get this job \n","done.  \n","\t     \n","\t     I noted that we have a long-term commitment to that.  \n","And so I would expect that we would put a lot more money into \n","this in the future .  But we want to do it wisely; we want to \n","spend the money wisely.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  What is it about this program that convinces \n","you that it will protect Russia's reforms and that Russia will be \n","in a position to may back the money they're supposed to pay back, \n","especially considering their other debt problem?\n","\t     \n","\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, look, I think \n","it's important to note that the United States on its own does not \n","have the capability to fuel a continuation of Russian reform.  \n","It's got to be a collective Western effort, and we're looking to \n","our allies to do more as well.  But beyond that, it's really what \n","the Russians do that is going to decide the fate of reform.  We \n","can simply play a role, and we feel we have an obligation to do \n","so, which is consistent with our national interests.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Did the President say that the value of the \n","U.S. contribution was that it would create security and \n","prosperity for the United States?  So what is it about this \n","program that does this?\n","\t     \n","\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think you have to \n","go back to the fundamental objective of our policy toward Russia, \n","and that is we want to do everything we can to support the \n","continuation of reform.  We are convinced that if reformers stay \n","in power, then we'll be able to continue the drawdown of nuclear \n","forces, foreign policy cooperation and economic interaction, \n","which are the three benefits to the United States from reform in \n","Russia.  So it's not a simple question.  You can't just say that \n","this program is the answer.  It's a long-term question and we \n","have to make a long-term commitment to it.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  And then on the question of Russia's ability to \n","repay, what convinces you they'll be able to pay seven to 15 \n","years from now?\n","\t     \n","\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, the Russian \n","government has made a commitment to repay, and what we're hoping \n","is that if reform continues, and if they can continue to improve \n","their oil and gas sector and earn additional hard currency \n","revenues, that Russia will be in a position six or seven years \n","from now to pay back those loans.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t     substantial government-to-government loan \n","we've ever gotten into with the Russians?\n","\t     \n","\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I don't want to \n","answer authoritatively on that.  I don't go back 20 or 30 years \n","on this.  But in the last four or five years, yes it is, because \n","the previous way that we financed grain exports was really to \n","just ensure private bank loans.  This is a different type of \n","effort.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t     government loans in any other sector that \n","you recall?  I know it wasn't done in --\n","\t     \n","\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think it's fair \n","to say this is a new and unique effort.\n","\n","\tClase: \n","talk.politics.misc\n","\n","\n","\tDocumento 3596: \n","THE WHITE HOUSE\n","\n","                    Office of the Press Secretary\n","_________________________________________________________________\n","For Immediate Release                             April 14, 1993     \n","\n","\t     \n","                       REMARKS BY THE PRESIDENT\n","                      AT SUMMER JOBS CONFERENCE\n","\n","\t     \t  \n","                            Hyatt Regency\n","                        Crystal City, Virginia  \n","\n","\n","11:22 A.M. EDT\n","\n","\t     \n","\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  The speech that \n","Octavius gave says more than anything I will be able to say today \n","about why it's important to give all of our young people a chance to \n","get a work experience and to continue to learn, to merge the nature \n","of learning and work; why it's important to honor the efforts of \n","people like Jerry Levin and Nancye Combs and Pat Irving and all of \n","those who are here.  \n","\t     \n","\t     I want to thank the Secretaries of Labor and Education \n","and all the people who work with them for sponsoring this; and my \n","good friend, Governor Wilder, for being here and for speaking; and \n","all of the business and local community leaders from the city and \n","county and state level from around America who are here. \n","\t     \n","\t     This has been a pretty fun day.  (Laughter.)  I loved \n","hearing the young people sing.  It was music to my ears because it is \n","their future that we are really struggling about.  (Applause.)  A \n","year and a half ago I began the quest to seek the presidency because \n","I was concerned about their future.  Because I believe that our \n","country, which had always been a beacon of hope for the young, had \n","too little opportunity, was too divided among ourselves across lines \n","of income and race and region and other ways, without a vision to \n","take us into the future.  \n","\t     \n","\t     I entered with the hope that together we could create \n","more opportunity and insist on much more responsibility from all of \n","our people.  But in the process we might recreate the best of \n","America's community, knowing that together we could always to more \n","than we could individually and that we might secure our future.\n","\t     \n","\t     All of you here today are committed to that.  The 1,000 \n","jobs that Jerry Levin has committed Time-Warner to is symbolic of the \n","commitments made by many of the private sector people who are here, \n","and those who are around the country.  The work that Nancye Combs \n","does, and the successes of all the young people like those on this \n","stage, and especially the eloquent statement Octavius Jeffers -- all \n","those things show that together we know what we need to do, and we're \n","on the right track.\n","\t     \n","\t     Last July when I was traveling across America's \n","heartland in my luxurious bus, I visited Seneca High School in \n","Louisville, Kentucky.  And there I met young people and business \n","people who were participating in the Louisville Education and \n","Employment Partnership.  I saw what Nancye Combs talked about today.  \n","I saw how the young people were making an extra effort to succeed \n","both in school and at work.  I saw, as I have seen many times in my \n","own state, the principle illustrated that Octavius has talked about \n","-- that for millions of American young people it is really an \n","impediment to both their learning and their ability to be good \n","workers to draw a sharp dividing line between what is work and what \n","is learning.\n","\t     \n","\t     In the world in which we are living, the average young \n","person will change the nature of work seven or eight times in a \n","lifetime.  We must learn to merge the work world and the learning \n","world much better.  And we must determine that all of our young \n","people see the opportunities that some of them have had showcased \n","here today.  \n","\t     \n","\t     Whether you're in business or in government or in \n","education, you know that we have a big job to do when it comes to \n","building a future that really, honestly includes opportunity for all \n","of our people.  There are still a lot of people who say, well, things \n","are pretty good here in Washington and everything's fine; the best \n","thing we can do about this whole thing is nothing.  They all have \n","jobs.  (Laughter.)  All the people who say that.  (Applause.)  \n","\t     \n","\t     They all have health insurance.  They all have a pretty \n","good education.  And they all have a pretty secure knowledge that \n","they'll be okay no matter what happens.  I say that not to be either \n","political or unduly critical, but to point out that one of the great \n","challenges of this age for every advanced nation -- everyone -- is to \n","fully develop the capacities of all of its people, and then find work \n","for them to do.\n","\t     \n","\t     All the European countries have higher unemployment \n","rates than we do, but also stronger support systems for the \n","unemployed.  The Japanese unemployment rate has been going up.  \n","They're going to adopt a stimulus that, even if you count it in its \n","most rigorous terms, is three or four times bigger than the one that \n","I have proposed to create jobs. \n","\t     \n","\t     In West Germany alone, the unemployment rate is now \n","about as high as ours.  This is a big problem for advanced nations.  \n","It costs a lot of money to add an extra employee, with a lot of \n","pressure from low-wage producers in other countries that are growing \n","their own economies and trying to provide new opportunity for their \n","people.  \n","\t     \n","\t     But it is especially important for America for two \n","reasons:  One is, we have a whole lot of folks who, unless we move \n","aggressively, will not have the education and skills we need to be \n","competitive and productive in a nation like this.  The second is, \n","even if we educate them all, if there aren't jobs they will be robbed \n","of the fruits of their educational labors.  People need to be able to \n","work in this country.  (Applause.)\n","\t     \n","\t     We have always had some unemployment; and, indeed, some \n","of it is normal.  You've always got some people leaving jobs and \n","moving around the country and doing first one thing and another.  We \n","have now, at this moment in our history, the necessity for all big \n","organizations, including the government, to reexamine the way they \n","are organized and who ask whether there are too many people working \n","at some kinds of jobs.  But in the whole, we must still be able to \n","create jobs in a country like America, to provide people with the \n","chance to work.  \n","\t     \n","\t     It's going to be difficult for me to make the welfare \n","reform proposals that I will make to Congress in the next couple of \n","months -- it's going to be hard for me to make those work if, at the \n","end of all this work, to get off welfare there isn't a job.  \n","(Applause.)\n","\t     \n","\t     So we have two tasks.  One is to develop the capacity of \n","the American people to perform without regard to race or income or \n","the circumstances of their birth.  The other is to make sure that \n","there are some opportunities for them to bring to bear for their \n","talent and to be rewarded with a paycheck.  It is a great challenge.  \n","I do not pretend that all of the answers are simple.  But I know if \n","you want to ask the American people, all of them, to be more \n","responsible, if you want to recreate a sense of community in this \n","country that bridges the lines of race and income and region, you \n","have got to have opportunity in that mix. \n","\t     \n","\t     A part of our vision for America has to be a future for \n","every young person in this country who's willing to play by the rules \n","and work hard and strive for the end of the rainbow.  There has to be \n","something at the end of that rainbow.  And that is what we are \n","basically here to talk about today:  What can we all do as partners, \n","recognizing none of us can do it alone, to develop the capacities of \n","our people to succeed wherever they live and whatever their \n","background.  And then, what can we do to make sure that there's \n","something there for them to do?\n","\n","\t     The summer jobs program we're discussing today is an \n","integral part of that plan, because it will promote the values of \n","work and opportunity and fairness, community.  It will put the people \n","first, and it does have a partnership between the public and private \n","sector.\n","\t     \n","\t     I said when I addressed the United States Congress in \n","February on this program that I would seek to create about 700,000 \n","extra summer jobs from government sources and then challenge the \n","American business community to meet that target so that we can create  \n","more than a million new summer jobs over and above what had been \n","created before.\n","\t     \n","\t     Many, many people have responded to that challenge.  And \n","Jerry is just a shining example of that which has been replicated in \n","this room and around the country -- people who are going to do more \n","than they otherwise would in the private sector to give young people \n","a work experience.  And it is terribly important.\n","\t     \n","\t     I want to emphasize that this summer jobs program is \n","part of an overall commitment to increase the capacity of the \n","American people -- from retraining defense workers who lose their \n","jobs and other adults who need to acquire new skills; to improving \n","the transition from school to work for young people who don't go to \n","college but do need at least two years of post-high school training \n","either on the job or in a community college or a vocational setting, \n","so that they can be competitive workers, making it possible for more \n","people to go on to college who do want to go.\n","\t     \n","\t     All these things are part and parcel of a comprehensive \n","plan.  It's also important, as I said, that we create more jobs.  The \n","emergency jobs program that I asked the Congress to adopt would \n","create a half a million extra jobs over the next year and a half, and \n","that would reduce the unemployment rate by a half a percent.  It \n","would also enable us to absorb more young people coming into the work \n","force in jobs that otherwise will not be created.\n","\t     \n","\t      It also will help a lot of cities and counties to \n","invest in things that need to be done at the grass-roots level --\n","projects long delayed, water projects, sewer projects, park projects, \n","new industries and particularly in small and medium-size communities \n","-- a whole range of things that will improve the economy and improve \n","the environment.  \n","\t     \n","\t     The summer jobs program is an important part of that \n","because we have tried for the first time, through the work of the \n","Labor Department and the Education Department and through reaching \n","out to people like you, to make this more than just a one-shot summer \n","jobs program; to integrate it with private sector efforts; to \n","hopefully replicate it in each coming summer; to move these young \n","people into further educational opportunities and to further job \n","opportunities; and to have a strong, meaningful education component \n","to these summer jobs -- something that the United States government \n","has never fully emphasized before.  \n","\t     \n","\t     A lot of these young people, as you well know, because \n","they come from difficult backgrounds, because they go to school in \n","difficult and challenging circumstances, need extra help in building \n","their basic skills in math and language, reasoning and in other \n","areas.  And a lot of educational studies show that young people who \n","have difficulty in school often forget as much as 30 percent of what \n","they learn over the summer and then that has to be repeated the next \n","year.  \n","\t     \n","\t     What we are trying to do here is to give people the \n","opportunity to learn good work habits and to reinforce their learning \n","skills and to put them together; and then, hopefully, over the next \n","couple of years, if our entire program passes, to give every school \n","in this country the opportunity to have a good work and learning \n","environment.  \n","\t     \n","\t     There will be more applied academics, more opportunities \n","for people to learn and work during the school year, so that this \n","will not simply be an isolated moment for these young folks, but will \n","be a part of building a whole new educational experience, a whole new \n","work experience, and moving on a pathway to a better future.\n","\t     \n","\t     The summer jobs programs are not designed to be make-\n","work jobs.  They're designed to make a future for the people holding \n","the job.  And that's what they will do.  In the process, they'll help \n","to build local communities, to strengthen local economies, to solve \n","local problems.  Real jobs -- renovating housing, repairing public \n","buildings, doing clerical work, providing nursing assistance in \n","hospitals, supervising and training children at child care centers, \n","and learning all the way.  Challenging young people to learn while \n","they earn, but letting them earn.\n","\t     \n","\t     You know, it's very difficult to make a case to people \n","who have never seen opportunity on their own street that they should \n","do this, that, or the other thing if there's no evidence of the \n","opportunity that's at the end of the effort.  I have not been sparing \n","in going for the last year-and-a-half into places where it isn't \n","exactly popular to say it, and say I wanted to reform the welfare \n","system; I wanted to toughen child support; I wanted to require people \n","to work; I was sick and tired of people being irresponsible in the \n","use of guns on the streets, and I wanted to change all that.  But if \n","you're going to summon people to greater responsibility, you have to \n","reward them when they do the right thing with opportunity.  \n","(Applause.)\n","\t     \n","\t     The young people we propose to put to work under our \n","program will spend 90 hours learning basic skills, such as math, \n","reading, writing -- either on the job in the classroom.  They will \n","stretch their minds as well as work up a sweat.  They will have a \n","sense of accomplishment.  It will literally be a summer challenge, \n","but a challenge that will take them into a different life.\n","\t     \n","\t     So I want to ask all of you to support this effort even \n","as I, as your President, support your effort.  At the end of the \n","summer we will evaluate all the young people who participate.  We'll \n","see whether they, instead of falling behind over the summer \n","academically as too many young people do, they stayed even or moved \n","ahead.  I suspect that they will.  \n","\t     \n","\t     This summer, Secretary Reich and Secretary Riley and I \n","will be visiting many of your communities.  We'll really try to learn \n","from you which of these efforts are working, what we should do next \n","summer, how we can build it in to what goes on during the school \n","year, how we can build in our job training efforts and the works that \n","we do with your companies to make sense of this whole thing -- so \n","that we maximize the impact of the taxpayer dollar and your private \n","investments as well. \n","\t     \n","\t     We want to honor the companies and the communities, the \n","business leaders and the young people who do the very best jobs this \n","summer.  And, again, I want to say to all of you in private business \n","who have matched our effort, I thank you.  And to all of you who \n","haven't, and those across the country who may listen or learn about \n","this event today, I want to implore other private employers to \n","stretch a little bit to give other young people a chance to work this \n","summer.  I'm telling you, we cannot go through another 10 years when \n","we don't give these children anything to say yes to.  If we exhort \n","them to do right, we've got to be able to reward them.  (Applause.)\n","\t     \n","\t     When the other speakers were talking, I was sitting up \n","here on the platform, listening and reveling.  And they got talking \n","about work, and I got to thinking about all the different things I've \n","done to make a living in my life.  When I was 13, I made a very \n","foolish short-term business investment:  I set up a comic book stand \n","and sold two trunks full of comic books.  Made more money than I had \n","ever had in my life.  But if I had saved those trunks, they'd be \n","worth $100,000 today.  (Laughter.)\n","\t     \n","\t     That does not mean young people should not be \n","entrepreneurial.  It just means that you can't foresee a generation \n","ahead.  I have mowed yards and cleared land and built houses and \n","worked in body shops and the parts departments of a car dealership.  \n","And I've done a lot of different things for a living.  Some \n","people say I got into politics to escape work.  (Laughter.)  \n","\t     \n","\t     I learned something from every job I ever had.  But I \n","grew up in a generation where I literally did not know a living soul \n","without regard to race or income who wanted to work who didn't have a \n","job.  I grew up in a generation when all you had to really say to \n","people is, get an education and you'll be all right.  You'll get a \n","job and you'll make more money next year than you did this year.  Now \n","I live in a generation full of people, most of whom don't make any \n","more money in real dollars than they did 10 years ago and they're \n","working longer hours and they're paying more for the basics of life.  \n","And we are now wondering whether we can create the jobs that these \n","young people want.\n","\t     \n","\t     Now, I want to close by reemphasizing these two things:  \n","It doesn't matter what kind of economic policies this administration \n","pursues, or how much productivity increases there are in the private \n","sector, if young Americans don't get a good education, don't learn \n","how to work and can't be productive, those jobs will not be created \n","in this country.  Machines will do the work or the work will be done \n","off-shore by people who have the same skill levels and can work for a \n","third or a fourth or a fifth the wages.  So nothing we can do \n","economically will matter unless we build the skills and capacities of \n","America's work force.  And anybody that pretends otherwise is just \n","kidding.  \n","\t     \n","\t     On the other hand, we need to be honest.  Every wealthy \n","country in the world, including the United States, is having \n","difficulty creating jobs.  If I knew everything that needs to be done \n","I'd be glad to tell you and we   could just call off the whole \n","deliberations of Congress and everything else.  I don't have all the \n","answers.  But I know this:  Doing nothing is not the answer.  \n","(Applause.)\n","\t     \n","\t     And so the jobs program that I have presented to \n","Congress, with the summer jobs, with the money for the cities and the \n","counties, through the Community Development Program, with the \n","infrastructure money, is a small part of a big budget.  It is an \n","attempt to engage in an experiment to see whether or not, with the \n","economy recovering in terms of corporate profit, we can give a little \n","boost to it, give opportunities to young people, create a half a \n","million jobs and maybe get the engine going again.\n","\t     \n","\t     Most of the jobs in this program are going to be jobs in \n","the private sector, not government jobs, even though it's government \n","money.  And the lion's share of the work in rebuilding the American \n","economy obviously will come from the private sector.  That's the kind \n","of system we have and it works pretty well.  \n","\t     \n","\t     But this is the challenge we have.  So I ask all of you \n","here today to support the summer jobs program, to ask your friends \n","and neighbors to support it, to go back home and ask your employers \n","to make a little extra effort; to do what you can to help me pass the \n","funds to create the 700,000 jobs that the United States government \n","should create this summer, so that together we can have this \n","partnership.  Because more than anything else, we have to give a \n","future -- a future that our young people can believe in.  \n","\t     \n","\t     We need to send them a message that here in America if \n","you study hard and work hard, if you obey the law and contribute \n","something to your community, you will be rewarded by your country.  \n","You can build a future from you own dreams. \n","\t     \n","\t     That has always been the promise of America.  Together \n","that's what this summer of challenge needs to be:  a reaffirmation of \n","the promise of America for so many young people to whom that promise \n","has been an illusion.  We can make it a reality.\n","\t     \n","\t     Thank you very much.

The federal budget \n","plan passed Congress in record time, and created a new sense of hope \n","and opportunity in the country.  \n","\t     \n","\t     Then, the short-term jobs plan I presented to Congress, \n","which would create a half a million jobs in the next two years passed \n","the House of Representatives two weeks ago.  It now has the support \n","of a majority of the United States Senate. \n","\t     \n","\t     All of these members of Congress know it's time to get \n","the economy moving again, to get job growth going again, to get a \n","fast start on the investments we need to build a lasting prosperity.  \n","Unfortunately, a minority of the members of the United States Senate \n","have used gridlock tactics to prevent their colleagues from working \n","the will of the majority on the jobs bill.\n","\t     \n","\t     When Congress returns, I ask every senator from every \n","state and from both parties to remember what is at stake.  The issue \n","is not politics, it's people.  Sixteen million of them are looking \n","for full-time jobs and can't find them.  These men and women don't \n","care about who's up or down in Washington.  They care about paying \n","the rent and meeting the mortgage payment, about putting food on the \n","table and buying shoes for their children, about regaining a sense of \n","dignity that comes from doing a day's work and supporting their \n","families and drawing a paycheck.\n","\t     \n","\t     They're asking those of us who have the privilege of \n","serving to put aside politics and do something now to move our \n","economy forward.  I am prepared to do that.  And I have been working \n","with the Senate to come up with an adjusted package that meets some \n","of the concerns of those who have been blocking action on the jobs \n","plan.  I'm willing to compromise, so long as we keep the focus on \n","jobs, keep the focus on growth and keep the focus on meeting unmet \n","national needs.  \n","\t     \n","\t     Our opponents have been asking for a smaller package.  \n","Today I ask them to join me in determining exactly what kind and what \n","size package Congress can approve that actually meets the needs of \n","the American people. \n","\t     \n","\t     But even as we make those reductions and the package \n","will be smaller, I believe we must address problems that are on the \n","minds of millions of Americans, and one in particular, and that is \n","the need to toughen law enforcement in our society to deal with the \n","dramatic rise in violent crime. \n","\t     \n","\t     So I will ask, even in this reduced package, for an \n","additional $200 million in federal funding to help local communities \n","to rehire police officers who have been laid off because of the \n","fiscal problems caused by the national recession.  Together, with a \n","matching effort by local governments, this could put as many as \n","10,000 police officers back on the job, and back on the beat in \n","communities all across our nation.\n","\t     \n","\t     At a time when too many of our people live in fear of \n","violent crime, when too many businesses have closed and too many \n","people have lost their jobs because people are afraid to leave their \n","homes, rehiring thousands of officers is one of the best investments \n","America can make.  And I ask both Houses of Congress to make that \n","investment in our people's safety and in their piece of mind.  \n","\t     \n","\t     I believe in the need for strong federal action to keep \n","the economy going toward recovery and to create jobs.  Make no \n","mistake about it:  I will fight for these priorities as hard as I \n","ever have.  I will never forget that the people sent me here to fight \n","for their jobs, their future and for fundamental change.\n","\t     \n","\t     I want to thank the police officers who are here today \n","and tell you that not a single one of them knew before they came here \n","that I had determined to ask for more money in this jobs bill to \n","rehire police officers.  They came here because they believe in the \n","summer jobs portion of the package.  And I want them to be free to \n","talk about that.  They came here not out of any law enforcement \n","concern other than the fact that they wanted the kids in this country \n","to have a chance to have jobs this summer, to have safer streets and \n","a brighter and more peaceful future.\n","\t     \n","\t     I say what I say today not just because it's good for \n","law enforcement but because it's good for the people who live in \n","these communities.  I have always supported community policing not \n","only because it helps to prevent crime and to lower the crime rate, \n","but because it cements better relationships between people in law \n","enforcement and the people that they're hired to protect.  It reduces \n","the chances of abusive action by police officers and increases the \n","chances of harmony and safe streets at the same time.\n","\t     \n","\t     These are the kinds of things that we are trying to do.  \n","I promised in my campaign that I'd do everything I could to put \n","another 100,000 police officers on the street over the next four \n","years.  This makes a good downpayment on that.  This keeps in mind \n","the core of the jobs package.  And this will help us to move forward.  \n","\t     \n","\t     So I ask the people in the Senate who have blocked the \n","jobs bill, let's work together.  I can accept a reduced package if \n","you will increase your commitment to safe streets.  I do not accept \n","the fact that we should reduce our commitment to summer jobs or to \n","building our infrastructure or to doing those other things that will \n","create real and lasting  prosperity for our people.  I have done my \n","part now to end the gridlock; I ask you to do yours.  \n","\t     \n","\t     I want now to give the people who are here with me on \n","the platform a chance to make some remarks and to be heard by the \n","American people -- beginning with Janet Reno, the distinguished \n","Attorney General.\n","  \n","\t     \n","\t     *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   * \n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Mr. President, can you tell us -- do you think that \n","the jobs package could be put in further jeopardy by controversy over \n","the suggestion of a VAT tax at this point in the congressional \n","dialogue?\n","\t     \n","\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Not at all.  I think it should have --\n","they wouldn't have any relationship one to the other.  First of all, \n","I made absolutely no decision on that.  You should know that there's \n","a lot of support in the business community and the labor community -- \n","people have asked us to consider that because of the enormous burden \n","of the present system on many of our major employers, particularly \n","many of those that we depend upon to generate jobs and to carry the \n","strength of this economy.  But I have made absolutely no decision \n","that would even approach that on that or any other kind of general \n","tax.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Do you personally believe that the American public \n","is ready to pay for -- to have another tax to pay for health care?  I \n","mean, apart from what business and labor leaders have said --\n","\t     \n","\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I'm not going to speculate on that.  I \n","will say this:  The real issue is how quickly we can recycle the \n","benefits of all the savings to cover the cost.  I mean, that is --\n","everyone knows that if you do what we're proposing to do, if you \n","streamline the insurance system, if you fix the system so that \n","there's no longer an enormous economic incentive to over-utilize or \n","over-provide certain services, if you provide primary and preventive \n","care in places where it isn't now, every single analysis shows \n","absolutely massive savings to the health care system.\n","\t     \n","\t     The real question is whether you can transfer those \n","savings to cover those who have no coverage now or those who have \n","virtually no coverage so that you provide people the security.  I \n","have no idea.  The polls say that, but I don't know.  All I know is \n","the polls that I see in the press that many of you have commissioned, \n","they say overwhelmingly the American people want the security of an \n","affordable health care system.\n","\t     \n","\t     But I don't think that has anything to do with this \n","stimulus, and it certainly shouldn't have.  People want a job first \n","and foremost.  They want that more than anything else.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Now that you've announced your willingness to \n","compromise on the stimulus package, can you tell us what parts of \n","your package you consider vital and uncompromisable?  I assume summer \n","jobs is one.\n","\t     \n","\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I want the summer jobs; I want the \n","highway program and I want the police program.  I still intend -- let \n","me say this:  I still intend to fully and aggressively push the crime \n","bill, which did not pass the Congress last year.  This is a \n","supplement to that, not a substitute for it in any way.  But I think \n","we need to do that.\n","\t     \n","\t     I think we need the Ryan White funds because of the \n","enormous health care burdens to the communities that are inordinately \n","and disproportionately affected by the problems of caring for people \n","with AIDS.  And there are several other things that I think should be \n","done.  We have to do the Agriculture Department meat inspectors; the \n","safety of the public depends on that.  \n","\t     \n","\t     There are a number of other things that I don't -- I \n","don't think any of it should be cut, but I have given Senator \n","Mitchell and Senator Byrd -- I talked to them.  And Senator Dole \n","called me yesterday to discuss this, and I told him that I would call \n","him back.  I called him back last night in New Hampshire and we \n","discussed this.  And I basically asked them to talk today, and said \n","that I would not make any statements about any specifics until at \n","least they had a chance to talk to see whether or not they could \n","reach some accord.  \n","\t     \n","\t     So I don't want to be any more specific than I have been \n","already, and let's see if they can talk it out.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  When you talked to Senator Dole and Senator \n","Mitchell did you tell them about your -- increase also, that $200 \n","million, that you want that as part of the package?\n","\t     \n","\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I did -- I told Senator -- I left word \n","for Senator Mitchell last night about it.  When I talked to Senator \n","Dole -- I don't remember for sure -- I do not believe I mentioned it.  \n","But I did tell him that I was prepared to reduce the package and I \n","wanted to break the gridlock, and I told him that I was working on a \n","reformulation of it so that -- in the hope that it would become even \n","more focused on jobs and the kinds of issues that I thought the \n","American people wanted us to address.  And this is certainly \n","consistent with that.\n","\t     \n","\t     Thank you.\n","\n","\tClase: \n","talk.politics.misc\n","\n","\n","\tDocumento 1191: \n","THE WHITE HOUSE\n","\n","                  Office of the Press Secretary\n","                  (Vancouver, British Columbia)\n","_________________________________________________________________\n","For Immediate Release                               April 4, 1993\n","\n","\t     \n","                PRESS CONFERENCE BY THE PRESIDENT\n","                        WITH RUSSIAN PRESS\n","\t     \n","                           Canada Place\n","                   Vancouver, British Columbia\n","\n","\n","\n","2:46 P.M. PDT\n","\n","\t     \t  \n","\t     Q\t  I had two questions for both Presidents, so you \n","could probably answer for Boris, too.  (Laughter.)\n","\t     \n","\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I'll give you my answer, then I'll \n","give you Yeltsin's answer.  (Laughter.)\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  The first is that this is the meeting of the \n","Presidents, so the money that's being promised is government \n","money, and naturally it's going to be distributed through the \n","government.  But you've indicated that three-quarters are going \n","to be going to businesses.  So the question is how the Russian \n","businesses themselves are going to be consulted, if ever?  What \n","are the priorities, because there are several association of \n","Russian businessmen existing already, so will they be invited to \n","participate in setting up priorities for investment?  \n","\t     \n","\t     This is the first.  And second, to you.  We know \n","that polls, public polls in America do not show that Americans \n","are very enthusiastic about giving this aid.  Like Newsweek polls \n","say that about 75 percent don't approve it, and New York Times \n","published that 52 percent support if it just prevents civil war; \n","42 percent if it fosters democratic reform; and only 29 percent \n","if it just personally supports Yeltsin.  How are you going to \n","sort of handle this problem that Americans themselves are not \n","very enthusiastic?  Thank you.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  I have a question, I'm sorry -- is there going \n","to be a translation of everything into Russian?  No, just the \n","answers.  Just the answers.  Okay.\n","\t     \n","\t     THE PRESIDENT:  The answer to the first question is, \n","it depends on what kind of aid we're discussing.  For example, \n","the funds that will be set up for financing new businesses will \n","obviously go to those businesses who apply and who seem to be \n","good risks and make the application.  The privatization fund will \n","be used to support the privatization of existing public \n","enterprises.  Then there are some other general funds in the \n","Democracy Corps and other things which people in Russia will have \n","some influence over the distribution of.  \n","\t     \n","\t     With regard to your second question, let me say that \n","I would think that there would be people in both countries who \n","would not feel too warmly toward simply the American government \n","giving money to the Russian government.  There's opposition to \n","that in Russia.  And in our country, throughout our whole history \n","there has been an opposition to foreign aid of all kinds.  That \n","is, this has nothing to do with Russia.  If you look at the whole \n","history of America, any kind of aid program has always been \n","unpopular.  \n","\t     \n","\t     What I have tried to tell the American people is, is \n","this is not an aid program, this is an investment program; that \n","this is an investment in our future.  We spent $4 trillion --\n","trillion -- on armaments on soldiers and other investments \n","because of the Cold War.  Now, with a democratic government in \n","Russia, with the newly independent states, the remainder of them \n","working on a democracy and struggling to get their economies \n","going, it seems to me very much in our interest to make it \n","possible to do whatever we can for democracy to survive, for the \n","economy of Russia to grow because of the potential for trade and \n","investment there, and for us to continue the effort to reduce \n","nuclear weapons and other elements of hostility on both sides, on \n","our side and on the Russian side.  \n","\t     \n","\t     So I don't see this as an aid program; this is an \n","investment for the United States.  This is very much in the \n","interest of the United States.  The things I announced today, the \n","second stage of the program, which I hope to put together next \n","week, in my view are things that are good for my country and for \n","the taxpayers and workers of my country.  \n","\t     \n","\t     Russia is a very great nation that needs some \n","partnership now, some common endeavor with other people who share \n","her goals.  But it would be a great mistake for anyone to view \n","this as some sort of just a charity or an aid issue.  That's not \n","what it is, it's an investment for America and it's a wonderful \n","investment.  \n","\t     \n","\t     Like all investments, there is some risk.  But \n","there's far less risk with a far greater potential of return than \n","the $4 trillion we spent looking at each other across the barrier \n","of the Cold War.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Mr. President, first of all thank you very \n","much, indeed, for coming here and talking to us.  In the memory \n","of the living correspondents, this is the first time an American \n","President is doing this to the Russian press corps, so it's kind \n","of a very measured breakthrough.  \n","\t     \n","\t     I have two questions.  One, in your introductory \n","remarks of the other press conference, you mentioned in brief \n","that you discussed the START II and START I issues.  Could you \n","tell us:  Did you reach an agreement with President Yeltsin as to \n","what might be done in order to have Ukraine join the ratification \n","of START I and the NPT regime?  And my second question is, how \n","confident you are that the United States Congress would be eager \n","to support you in lifting Jackson-Vanik and other restrictions \n","inherited from the Cold War?  \n","\t     \n","\t     PRESIDENT CLINTON:  First, we discussed the issue of \n","Ukraine with regard to START I and NPT, and generally, with \n","regard to the need to proceed to have the other independent \n","states all be non-nuclear; but also to have the United States \n","develop strong relationships with them.  We know that one thing \n","that we could do that would increase, I think, the willingness of \n","the Ukraine to support this direction is to successfully conclude \n","our own negotiations on highly enriched uranium, because that \n","would provide not only an important economic opportunity for \n","Russia, but also for Ukraine, and it would show some reaching out \n","on our part.  But we agreed that basically the people who signed \n","off on the Lisbon Protocol have got to honor what they did, and \n","we agreed to continue to press that.\n","\t     \n","\t     I, myself, have spent a good deal of time trying to \n","reassure Ukraine's leaders, specifically the President and the \n","Foreign Minister, that I want strong ties with Ukraine, that the \n","United States very much wants a good relationship with Ukraine, \n","but that, in order to do what we need to do together to \n","strengthen the economy of Ukraine and to have the United States \n","be fully supportive, the commitment to ratify START I and to join \n","the NPT regime is critical.\n","\t     \n","\t     What was the second question?  \n","\t     \n","\t     THE PRESIDENT:  With regard to Jackson-Vanik and \n","COCOM, I would make two points:  First, I have agreed with the \n","Republican and Democratic leaders in the Congress that we will, \n","as soon as I return, have a list of all the legislative and other \n","restrictions, some of them are regulatory in nature, imposed on \n","relations between the United States and Russia, that are legacies \n","of the Cold War.  And we will see whether they're -- how many of \n","them we could agree to do away with right now, at least among the \n","leadership of the Congress.\n","\t     \n","\t     With regard to Jackson-Vanik, I think there will be \n","an openness to change the law if the Congress is convinced there \n","are, in fact, no more refusniks, no more people who wish to \n","emigrate who are not being allowed to.  If the fact is that there \n","is no one there who would have been -- who the law was designed \n","to affect, then I think that the desire to keep the law will be \n","much less.\n","\t     \n","\t     With regard to COCOM, my guess is, and it's nothing \n","more than a guess, that the leadership of Congress and indeed my \n","own advisers, might prefer to see some sort of phased movement \n","out of the COCOM regime.  But I think they would be willing to \n","begin it in the fairly near future.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Mr. Clinton, when I read your speech in \n","Annapolis, I got the impression that you have a completely \n","different personal -- and I stress that -- personal, not \n","political approach towards Russia, compared to the approach of \n","Mr. Bush.  Could you formulate in a few words, what is the \n","difference between you as a personality and your approach -- the \n","difference between your approach to Russia and the approach of \n","Mr. Bush?  And who made you -- why did you cite Akhmatova in the \n","last part of your speech?\n","\t     \n","\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Let me say, first, I do not wish to \n","compare myself with President Bush or anyone else.  I can't say \n","what was in his heart about Russia.  I can say that since I was a \n","boy, I have been personally fascinated with the history, the \n","music and the culture, and the literature of Russia.  I have been \n","thrilled by Russian music since I was a serious student of music \n","for more than 30 years now.  I have read major Russian novelists \n","and many of your poets and followed your ballet and tried to know \n","as much as I could about your history.  \n","\t     \n","\t     And I went to the Soviet Union -- but it was then \n","the Soviet Union -- you may know it was a big issue in the last \n","presidential campaign that I spent the first week of 1970 alone \n","in Moscow and did not return again until three days before Mr. \n","Yeltsin was elected President.  But all that time I was away, I \n","was following events there very closely and hoping for the day \n","when we could be genuine partners.  So I have always had a \n","personal feeling about Russia.  \n","\t     \n","\t     I remember, for example -- a lot of you know I like \n","music very much.  One of the most moving experiences for me as a \n","musician was when Leonard Bernstein took the New York \n","Philharmonic to Moscow and played Shostakovich's Fifth Symphony \n","to the Russians.  And he played the last movement more rapidly \n","than anyone had ever played it before because it was technically \n","so difficult.  That is something I followed very closely when it \n","occurred.  \n","\t     \n","\t     These are things that have always had a big impact \n","on my life.  And I had just always hoped that someday, if I ever \n","had the chance to, I could play a role in seeing our two \n","countries become closer partners.

Therefore it is foolish to be an atheist.\n","\n","Response:\n","\n","This argument is known as Pascal's Wager.  It has several flaws.\n","\n","Firstly, it does not indicate which religion to follow.  Indeed, there are\n","many mutually exclusive and contradictory religions out there.  This is often\n","described as the \"avoiding the wrong hell\" problem.  If a person is a\n","follower of religion X, he may end up in religion Y's version of hell.\n","\n","Secondly, the statement that \"If you believe in God and turn out to be\n","incorrect, you have lost nothing\" is not true.  Suppose you're believing in\n","the wrong God -- the true God might punish you for your foolishness.\n","Consider also the deaths that have resulted from people rejecting medicine in\n","favour of prayer.\n","\n","Another flaw in the argument is that it is based on the assumption that \n","the two possibilities are equally likely -- or at least, that they are of \n","comparable likelihood.  If, in fact, the possibility of there being a God \n","is close to zero, the argument becomes much less persuasive.  So sadly the\n","argument is only likely to convince those who believe already.\n","\n","Also, many feel that for intellectually honest people, belief is based on \n","evidence, with some amount of intuition.  It is not a matter of will or \n","cost-benefit analysis.\n","\n","Formally speaking, the argument consists of four statements:\n","\n","  1. One does not know whether God exists.\n","  2. Not believing in God is bad for one's eternal soul if God does\n","     exist.\n","  3. Believing in God is of no consequence if God does not exist.\n","  4. Therefore it is in one's interest to believe in God.\n","\n","There are two approaches to the argument.  The first is to view 1 as an\n","assumption, and 2 as a consequence of it.  One problem with this approach, in\n","the abstract, is that it creates information from no information.  This is\n","considered invalid in information theory.  Statement 1 indicates one has no\n","information about God -- but statement 2 indicates that beneficial information\n","can be gained from the absolute lack of information about God.  This violates\n","information entropy -- information has been extracted from no information, at\n","no \"cost\".\n","\n","The alternative approach is to claim that 1 and 2 are both assumptions.  The\n","problem with this is that 2 is then basically an assumption which states the\n","Christian position, and only a Christian will agree with that assumption. The\n","argument thus collapses to \"If you are a Christian, it is in your interests\n","to believe in God\" -- a rather vacuous tautology, and not the way Pascal\n","intended the argument to be viewed.\n","\n","The biggest reason why Pascal's wager is a failure is that if God is\n","omniscient he will certainly know who really believes and who believes as\n","a wager.  He will spurn the latter... assuming he actually cares at all\n","whether people believe in him.\n","\n","------------------------------\n","\n","Subject: What is Occam's Razor?\n","\n","Typical posting:\n","\n","People keep talking about Occam's Razor.

Furthermore, there is much evidence,\n","observation and theory that can explain many of the complexities of the\n","universe and life on earth.\n","\n","The origin of the Argument by Design is a feeling that the existence of\n","something as incredibly intricate as, say, a human is so improbable that\n","surely it can't have come about by chance; that surely there must be some \n","external intelligence directing things so that humans come from the chaos\n","deliberately.\n","\n","But if human intelligence is so improbable, surely the existence of a mind\n","capable of fashioning an entire universe complete with conscious beings must\n","be immeasurably more unlikely?  The approach used to argue in favour of the\n","existence of a creator can be turned around and applied to the Creationist\n","position.\n","\n","This leads us to the familiar theme of \"If a creator created the universe,\n","what created the creator?\", but with the addition of spiralling \n","improbability.  The only way out is to declare that the creator was not\n","created and just \"is\" (or \"was\").\n","\n","From here we might as well ask what is wrong with saying that the universe\n","just \"is\" without introducing a creator?  Indeed Stephen Hawking, in his book\n","\"A Brief History of Time\", explains his theory that the universe is closed\n","and finite in extent, with no beginning or end.\n","\n","The Argument From Design is often stated by analogy, in the so-called \n","Watchmaker Argument.  One is asked to imagine that one has found a watch on\n","the beach.  Does one assume that it was created by a watchmaker, or that it\n","evolved naturally?  Of course one assumes a watchmaker.  Yet like the \n","watch, the universe is intricate and complex; so, the argument goes, the \n","universe too must have a creator.\n","\n","The Watchmaker analogy suffers from three particular flaws, over and above \n","those common to all Arguments By Design.  Firstly, a watchmaker creates \n","watches from pre-existing materials, whereas God is claimed to have \n","created the universe from nothing.  These two sorts of creation are \n","clearly fundamentally different, and the analogy is therefore rather weak.\n","\n","Secondly, a watchmaker makes watches, but there are many other things in \n","the world.  If we walked further along the beach and found a nuclear \n","reactor, we wouldn't assume it was created by the watchmaker.  The argument \n","would therefore suggest a multitude of creators, each responsible for a \n","different part of creation.\n","\n","Finally, in the first part of the watchmaker argument we conclude that \n","the watch is not part of nature because it is ordered, and therefore \n","stands out from the randomness of nature.  Yet in the second part of the \n","argument, we start from the position that the universe is obviously not \n","random, but shows elements of order.

But,\n","   amazingly, those events turn out to be the saving of the Jews\n","   and of Judaism.\n","        The sale of Joseph by his brothers looked like the breakup\n","   of the family.  But in fact, it ended with a reconciliation of\n","   the quarrel between them. The famine that drove the family out\n","   of Canaan looked like a misfortune for them.  But in fact, if\n","   they had stayed in Canaan, they would almost certainly have\n","   intermarried with the Canaanites and been assimilated into\n","   their culture.  Their oppression by the Egyptians a few\n","   generations after their arrival in Egypt again looked like a\n","   disaster. But God used it to bring them out of Egypt, and into\n","   the Promised Land.\n","        Here the people built a Temple, and regularly offered\n","   sacrifices. But the Babylonians captured Jerusalem and Judea,\n","   destroyed Temple and city and countryside, and deported most of\n","   the people to Babylon. You might have thought that that would\n","   be the end of the people and the religion. But it was not.\n","   Living in Canaan, the people had been under constant danger of\n","   assimilation.  Again and again, they had turned from the\n","   worship of the LORD to the worship of the Canaanite fertility\n","   cults, with their ritual prostitution and ritual human\n","   sacrifice. The Babylonian captivity put a stop to that. Never\n","   again did the Jews show any interest in polytheism or idolatry.\n","   Neither the worship of the Canaanites mor that of the\n","   Babylonians ever again had a foothold among them.\n","        Nor is that all. Judaism had been in danger of becoming\n","   simply a system of sacrifices and Temple observances. The only\n","   prescribed acts of worship consisted of coming to Jerusalem\n","   every so often and offering a sacrifice. During the Captivity,\n","   with the Temple gone, the Jews invented the synagogue, a place\n","   of meeting for reading and study and discussion of the\n","   Scriptures. They came to realize clearly, what they were in\n","   danger of forgetting while they continued to live in Judea,\n","   that God is not simply a local or tribal deity, not just the\n","   controller of the land of Canaan, or the patron of the Jewish\n","   people, but the Creator of the world, and the Ruler and Judge\n","   of all humans everywhere.\n","        Time passed, and the Babylonian Empire was replaced by\n","   that of the Persians, and then that of the Greeks, or rather\n","   the Macedonians. The ruler, Antiochus Epiphanes, was determined\n","   to stamp out Judaism, and to this end he made the reading and\n","   the study of the Torah punishable by death. Again, one might\n","   think that this would be the end of Judaism. But it was not.\n","   The people met for worship, and instead of reading the Torah\n","   portion appointed for the day, they would read some passage\n","   from the prophets that had a similar theme, and then discuss\n","   that.  Before this time, the Torah, the so-called Five Books of\n","   Moses (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy)\n","   were the only books read and studied in the synagogue.  If it\n","   had not been for Antiochus, the books of the prophets would\n","   probably have been forgotten altogether. His hatred for Judaism\n","   saved them.\n","\n","        [Other examples here omitted for brevity's sake.]\n","\n","        Some of you may remember that Julie Andrews first became\n","   famous as Eliza Doolittle in the stage production of MY FAIR\n","   LADY. When Warner Brothers undertook to make a movie of it,\n","   everyone expected that Julie, who had been so magnificent on\n","   stage, would play the same role in the movie. Instead, the\n","   studio decided to go with an established screen star, and cast\n","   Audrey Hepburn.  Julie Andrews was naturally crushed. But she\n","   later realized that if she had played the screen role, she\n","   would have been type-cast for life as an Elize Doolittle type.\n","   It would have been a disaster for her. As it was, Walt Disney\n","   offered her the role of Mary Poppins, and she won an Oscar for\n","   it.  At the presentation, she stood there, smiling, and looking\n","   at Walt Disney, she said, \"And now, my special thanks to the\n","   man who made all this possible -- JACK WARNER!\" It was the most\n","   memorable line of the evening.\n","        In a similar spirit, we Jews might thank the men who in\n","   the providence of God have preserved Judaism, and kept it alive\n","   to this day, beginning with Joseph's brothers, and continuing\n","   with two Pharaohs, with Nebuchadnezzar, with Antiochus\n","   Epiphanes....\n","\n","After the formal meeting had broken up, one woman came up to him\n","privately and said, \"You were talking about the Holocaust, weren't\n","you?\" He answered, \"If that is an example that came to your mind,\n","then you are right, I was talking about it to you. But I would not\n","talk about it to everyone, for not everyone can bear it.\" I assume\n","that he meant that, without the Holocaust, there would have been no\n","state of Israel.\n","\n","Someone hearing the rabbi's lecture might leap to the conclusion\n","that God is dependent on the wickedness of men to accomplish His\n","purposes -- or at least that the rabbi thought so. He might then  go\n","on to suppose that the wickedness is in fact God's doing -- that He\n","stirred up Joseph's brothers to a murderous hate against him, and\n","that when the Israelites were in Egypt, God hardened Pharaoh's\n","heart, so that he oppressed the people, and would not let them go.\n","And this raises questions about how an action can be considered\n","wicked and at the same time be considered something that God has\n","brought about.\n","\n","I suggest another way of looking at it. Consider a sculptor who has\n","a log of wood from which he proposes to carve a statue. But the log,\n","instead of having a smooth even grain throughout, has a large knot\n","that spoils the appearance of the surface. The sculptor considers\n","the wood for a while, and then carves a statue that features the\n","knot, that makes that particular interruption in the grain and color\n","of the wood correspond to some feature of the statue, so that\n","observers will say: \"How fortunate the sculptor was in finding a\n","piece of wood with a knot like that in just the right place. Its\n","presence is the crowning touch, the thing that makes the statue a\n","great work of art.\" In reality, the knot, far from being what the sculptor was\n","looking for, was a challenge to his skill. If the wood had not\n","contained that flaw, he would still have made a great work of art,\n","but a different one. So, if Joseph's brothers had not sold him, God\n","would still have brought about His purposes for the Jewish people,\n","but He would have done so in another manner. If Judas had not\n","betrayed Jesus, if Caiaphas and his fellow leaders had not rejected\n","Jesus, but had rather acknowledged Him as the Annointed of God, if\n","Pilate had followed his conscience rather than his fears and had set\n","Jesus free, it might appear that there would have been no\n","Crucifixion, and therefore no Redemption, and therefore no\n","Salvation. Not so. God did not need Judas' sin to redeem us. If\n","Judas had done right, then God in Christ would still have reconciled\n","the world to Himself.  We do not know how, just as we do not know\n","how Michelangelo would have painted the Sistine Chapel if its\n","interior had instead been shaped like Grand Central Station, and\n","just as we do not know how Bobby Fisher would have won his fourth\n","game agianst Spassky if Spassky had refused the exchange of bishops\n","and had attacked Fisher's knight instead (don't bother to look up\n","the game in question--I am making up this example, but the point is\n","none the less valid).\n","\n","Thus, we may say both (1) that God used, say, the cowardice of\n","Pilate to accomplish His purposes, and (2) that the said cowardice\n","was not God's doing, and that Pilate would not have thwarted God's\n","plans by behaving justly and courageously.\n","\n","What, then, are we to make of the place where God says to Moses, \"I\n","will harden Pharaoh's heart, so that he will not let the people go\"?\n","Some Christians have taken this to mean that Pharaoh was a puppet\n","with God pulling the strings, and that his stubbornness and cruelty\n","were not his own work, but the work of God in him. I suppose rather\n","that what God was telling Moses was something like this: \"If you see\n","that Pharaoh is not willing to let the people go, do not be\n","discouraged, or suppose that the situation is out of my control. My\n","purposes will not be thwarted. If Pharaoh chooses to hear you and\n","let the people go, well and good. If he does not, I will fit his\n","resistance into my plans, and fit it so perfectly that future\n","historians and theologians will suppose that I would have been\n","thrown for a loss if Pharaoh had obeyed me.\"\n","\n","To return to the question that started this all off. Is it possible\n","that the Serbs, in slaughtering the Moslems of Bosnia, are\n","instruments of God's will?\n","     First point. What they are doing is wrong, just as what\n","Joseph's brothers did was wrong, just as what Judas did was wrong.\n","They intend it for evil. If God somehow brings good out of it, that\n","does not make them any less subject to just condemnation and\n","punishment.\n","     Second point. Of course, God will bring good out of it. But not\n","the same good that He would have brought if the Serbians had\n","refrained from the sins of robbery and rape and murder.

Los documentos seleccionados como similares pertenecen todos a la misma categoría y tratan todos de tematicas similares, considero que en este caso los documentos son similares.\n","- Tercer documento seleccionado (4641): Pertenece a la categoria med y trata sobre el uso de ultrasonido en obstreticia y una discusión sobre quien está calificado para interpretar los resultados. En los documentos seleccionados como similares existen 2 documentos que son muy similares, tratan sobre los mismos topicos pero no tienen similitud en cuanto al topico central con los otros documentos similares que tratan de derechos humanos en el medio oriente.\n","- Cuarto documento seleccionado (339): Pertenece a la clase comp.os.ms-windows.misc y trata sobre los desafíos de desarrollo de software en múltiples plataformas (específicamente Mac y DOS/Windows) dentro de una red local (LAN), y cómo la falta de herramientas adecuadas para compartir archivos y controlar versiones afecta la productividad del equipo. Los documentos similares son todos parecidos entre sí pero no tratan de topicos o no utilizan un lenguaje similar al documento objetivo, no es buena la similitud.\n","- Quinto documento seleccionado (posición 2573): Pertenece a la categoria comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware y trata sobre el desarrollo de un simulador de un microcontrolador con fines educativos; es un mensaje técnico en un foro o un grupo de discusión, donde alguien solicita ayuda o recursos para el desarrollo.
